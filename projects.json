In Exodus, players have a large choice of skills and activities in which they can gather resources, produces new items, earn experience points, earn in-game currency, earn NFTs, trade, and interact with other players. Exodus provides hundreds of hours of activities and content, making it a valuable asset for user retention and engagement.\n\nIn 2023, Exodus has reached a net of 8000 all-time accounts created, having a current average of 75 weekly unique users. During that same time, Exodus released a variety of content and hosted several in-world holiday events. To give some examples, in 2023 Exodus released: Player-to-Player trading, Multiplayer Item Dropping, Workshopping Skill, Combat Alpha Content, Player Owned Pets, UI Overhauls, Scene Overhauls. As well, Exodus hosted multiplayer in-world events for: Valentines Day, Easter, Business Week, Exodus's Birthday, and Thanksgiving. Exodus’s holiday events always offer a boon to player engagement, with past events averaging in around 500 new accounts created per event and 2000 NFTs given out as gameplay rewards. We believe that Decentraland needs engaging games like Exodus in order to retain DAU and drive organic growth. Exodus provides a fun experience where users play can interact with each other for a large number of hours without running out of activities or things to do. Moreover, consistently hosting interactive holiday events helps retain existing and returning users by providing them with consistent updates and content to look forward to.\n\nCheck out our socials at: https://X.com/ExodusGBW\n\nPlay at: https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=baldr&position=124%2C55&island=baldr1u7q\n\n**Enhancements**\n\nExpanding Exodus by introducing new skills and multiplayer mechanics will further refine Exodus' ability to attract new users and retain them. With this grant, Exodus will focus on a few primary objectives: Potion Making, Farming, and Multiplayer Enhancements.  The introduction of our Potion Making and Farming skills will provide even more hours of content for our players as well as prove our commitment to releasing new content for already existing players. Lastly, we intend to enhance already existing content, like fishing, mining, and woodcutting, to have multiplayer features - this will help make our content more engaging and interactive.\n\nIn addition to these enhancements, Exodus plans to be a regular and continuing host of in-world events for a variety of holidays.

Now, our main goal is to enhance the stability of the Explorers and let them to a final version. VR is working very well but the UI/UX needs to move to 3D interactions instead. Finally, the Bevy Desktop client now allows us to quickly introduce and test new features for content creators, like lights, cinematic cameras, GLTF manipulation, and so on.","category":"Platform","platform":{"impactMetrics":"- Bevy Explorer on https://github.com/decentraland/bevy-explorer\n- Godot Explorer on https://github.com/decentraland/godot-explorer\n- Entire project tracking: https://github.com/orgs/decentraland/projects/43 "},"beneficiary":"0x04812c531083054863ef354EF600A61857921466","description":"\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/723PkKB.png)\n\n## Introduction\nWe are very excited to have met and achieved the objectives outlined in our latest proposal. Whether in the Godot-developed client for mobile or Bevy for desktop, it is possible to enter and explore the different worlds of Decentraland, interact with other players, customize your avatar, and discover all new places. Thanks to this solid base, today we are in very good shape to propose even more and enrich the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n## The Bevy client as a springboard for creators\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/3yu0Ckr.png)\n\nOn the one hand, we have the client made in Bevy, which, while **working very well and smoothly**, is the perfect scenario to test and iterate on new functionalities that will **enrich the content in Decentraland**.\n\nWe want to allow content creators to **add lights, set up ambient lighting**, and **access the GLTF internal content** in order to accelerate the creation pipeline based on this really solid standard. Additionally, we know some features *are long overdue* and need to be released as soon as possible, such as **cinematic camera and scrollable UI.**\n\nIterating on these new functionalities in the Bevy client first will allow us to quickly discover if there are blockers or any challenges, and **make appropriate documentation and specifications** so that both the Mobile/VR client in Godot and the Foundation Desktop in Unity can easily implement them as well.\n\n## The Mobile and VR era for Decentraland\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/n0gkf7f.png)\n\nDevelopments on the Godot client have focused on providing a *final beta product*, and this is now ready to be used. The mobile versions **are already in stores**, in a **public beta** and you *can explore* any type of scene and *interact with other players*.\n\nHaving worked in the last grant to prepare the foundations serving Mobile and VR, we can now iterate to **improve performance and optimization** to achieve a solid experience in both targets. At the same time, we want to start focusing on perfecting both products by adding ambient sounds, music, alerts and differentiating them by **adding a UX designed specifically for VR**.\n\nIn terms of optimization, we will do research to minimize annoying hiccups which, although already improved over the web client, are not tolerable for the VR version. In this sense, we will work together with Bevy if it is necessary to expose tools that allow this to be improved on the content creator's side. We'll also provide guides and development tools for content creators to test their scenes on Mobile and VR.\n\n## Old content also matter\nWe’re going to keep implementing the **SDK6 Adaptation Layer**, so old content is accessible from our Explorers. This is an SDK7 scene that can run the SDK6 scene converting the messages to be used by the SDK7 runtime.\n\nPublic document with this same information, just in case:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1aefap7cayJGMfEUmyHViwFRlkD4sROGfE9HALqnj1PY\n\nWatch our videos!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8kyCvauFQ&list=PLBmhkGNdurqgz7OD5uDIdDVYvGkBIApCo&index=4","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Managing","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Project managing, track issues and progress, write proposals, lead roadmap, liaison with Foundation, doing presentations.\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/sdk/issues ","relevantLink":"https://github.com/orgs/decentraland/projects/43","estimatedBudget":7560},{"concept":"Core Engine development","duration":6,"aboutThis":" Develop and maintain godot-explorer and bevy-explorer repository\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/godot-explorer  https://github.com/decentraland/bevy-explorer ","relevantLink":"https://github.com/decentraland/godot-explorer","estimatedBudget":145500},{"concept":"Operating Cost","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Servers, CI minutes, licenses, certificates, and remaining will be reused or refunded to the DAO\n","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":2500}],"projectDuration":6,"vestingStartDate":"1st","categoryAssessment":{"impactMetrics":"- Bevy Explorer on https://github.com/decentraland/bevy-explorer\n- Godot Explorer on https://github.com/decentraland/godot-explorer\n- Entire project tracking: https://github.com/orgs/decentraland/projects/43 "}},"discourse_topic_id":22321,"scores_total":11547742.766421063,"votes":89,"manaVP":244891.87700314625,"landVP":1498000,"namesVP":429500,"delegatedVP":9147582.889417924,"vesting_addresses":["0xe7924d7892605e2d3a96d539e326426364d7fc37"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"3f6c2ec3-c70e-4040-85d9-331832a4bc17","size":155560,"beneficiary":"0x04812c531083054863ef354EF600A61857921466","category":"Platform","tier":"Higher Tier","done_updates":5,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2024-10-26T13:30:18.096Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"f38cf299-f5df-45b7-b08c-716c49dc14d9","snapshot_id":"0x061be8a43d0eae483d145bc8d73af346fdb4fede1bd1bd2a1fe6c41c134db52b","user":"0xf0480e7b09edb7229d4f7b3b25ef77429c5754cf","type":"grant","title":"Grant Support Squad H2 2024","start_at":"2024-04-05T14:10:00.634Z","finish_at":"2024-04-19T14:10:00.632Z","required_to_pass":4048000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":71200,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"pablo.lewin@decentraland.org","title":"Grant Support Squad H2 2024","choices":["yes","no","abstain"],"funding":71200,"members":[{"name":"Fifi Real (Fifitango)","role":"Grants Manager","about":"Fifi is an Agile Coach, Scrum Master Certified, and Trans Art-ivist based in Buenos Aires, with over 18 years of experience in Software Development.

We want to lower the barriers for creating engaging and dynamic experiences within Decentraland. We imagine tons of Decentraland Worlds populated with many different game types - from shooters to scavenger hunts, from races to mazes -  all created by Decentraland users without having to code one line.\n\n**Problem**\n**TL,DR**: There isn’t any “addictive” or “repetitive” content within Decentraland. It’s tough to create scenes, there are other metaverses making it easier to create and play within their platform, and there’s not enough reason (content) for people to stay or come back.\n\nThere are few problems within the current Decentraland ecosystem:\n- The first being a high level requirement for coding experiences. Prior to the In World Builder, an extensive knowledge of the Decentraland SDK and/or other coding practices were required to develop even a simple live stream scene.\n- Currently, Decentraland is having a hard time retaining both creators and users. The difficulty to create engaging and interactive experiences has taken a toll on the growth and activity of the platform. The lack of engaging content has driven users to other metaverse platforms and the creators have followed.\n- Incentivization, or lack there of - both from a creator perspective and a user perspective\n\n**Solution**\nWith the IWB Game Creator, We are going to create multiple different game systems which can be clicked and placed within your Decentraland scene INSIDE Decentraland. These game systems will be complimentary to the extensive catalog of 3d assets already available in IWB. \n*ex. Imagine wanting to create a maze game. With IWB Game Creator, pick and place your environment assets from the IWB Catalog; choose and drop your puzzle pieces and clues along the maze route; add a timer for competitive gameplay; determine your win conditions and rewards. Click create and your game is immediately available to play by all visitors to your World!*\n\nEach game system will have additional customizations for the creator to vary game play. We will have 3 high level game loops that can be further customized to create many different game modes.\n**Game Systems**\n* Time Based System - *Mazes, escape rooms, parkour, races, scavenger hunts*\n* Combat System - *shooters, deathmatches, battle royales, king of the hill*\n* Wave System - *duck hunt, asteroid, enemy wave shooter, arcade shooter*\n\n**Templates**\nInclude the “free sample” templates along with the ingredients for these games. (ie. a complete maze game, a complete pvp arena for deathmatch…)\n\n**Summary**\nWe have built the foundation for creators to build amazing scenes and experiences without coding knowledge or 3d modeling experience all done INSIDE Decentraland with the In World Builder. The IWB Game Creator makes it easy to create interactive games and experiences with the click of a button. Our goal with the IWB Game Creator is to achieve the “addictive” and “repetitive” gamer behavior  through simple, yet powerful games.\n","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Programming","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Create the game systems as modular code bases to easily integrate into the current In World Builder infrastructure","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":78000},{"concept":"3D Asset Creation","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Development of 3D asset catalog, new game assets, optimizations","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":15000},{"concept":"QA & Testing","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Integrated testing, quality assurance and bug fixing into the project entirety","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":12000},{"concept":"Game Design","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Identify all the game configuration requirements for each game system, building out the structure of each game system for the programming team to implement, creating technical documents","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":5000},{"concept":"User Interface / User Design","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Hyper focused team on creating the easiest to use, most intuitive user interface and experience for anyone building with the In World Builder tool","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":2000},{"concept":"Competitions & Prizes","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Create build competitions and offer rewards","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1000},{"concept":"Project Management","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Proposal creation, team management, project management, scheduling, progression tracking and software sprint setup","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":7000},{"concept":"Server Costs","duration":5,"aboutThis":"Two years of server costs","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":2000}],"projectDuration":5,"vestingStartDate":"1st","categoryAssessment":{"impactMetrics":"Code contributions to repositories\nIn World analytics - games played, games made, assets used, games won, games lost"}},"discourse_topic_id":22158,"scores_total":11794404.88526137,"votes":152,"manaVP":69092.82477135357,"landVP":152000,"namesVP":302300,"delegatedVP":11196066.060490018,"vesting_addresses":["0x2EfcbDea08eFE760DbC9D0E04a605C2e987F84D9"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"4d32b2c8-1fca-4692-8186-30b9379f3c0e","size":122000,"beneficiary":"0xe96f1c6B08b1d932Df11E78A040a75B546ab8d2B","category":"Platform","tier":"Higher Tier","done_updates":4,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":1,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2024-08-30T21:00:59.370Z","pending_updates":1},{"id":"fdae4090-2db5-11ee-a512-65477fceb1b0","snapshot_id":"0xc8add02aa28a7b455a4202f657da278cc307883684234e997d724919666b180c","user":"0x8958bdbeeeeb1a0e3eeec3306e7fc07ca3edd7d8","type":"grant","title":"Creativity & Growth - Sandstorm Creator platform","start_at":"2023-07-29T02:16:00.345Z","finish_at":"2023-08-12T02:16:00.344Z","required_to_pass":6000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":120000,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"oscom@sandstorm.co","title":"Creativity & Growth - Sandstorm Creator platform","choices":["yes","no","abstain"],"funding":120000,"members":[{"name":"Steve McGarry","role":"CEO","about":"10+ years in crypto.

Aimed at bridging the gap between design and development, this tool eliminates the need for extensive coding knowledge, making the process of creating engaging and interactive UIs accessible to a broader range of creators.\n**Current Challenges:** The existing workflow for developing UIs in Decentraland involves a multi-step process where designers conceptualize UIs using graphic design tools like Canva or Figma, followed by developers translating these designs into code. This workflow is not only time-consuming but also requires a specific skill set, limiting the number of individuals who can contribute to creating interactive experiences in Decentraland.\n**Solution:** The Decentraland No-Code UI Design Studio simplifies this workflow by providing an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that allows users to select, customize, and integrate a wide range of UI elements directly into Decentraland scenes.

I made some improvements to the infrastructure and shifted data around so that I could costs. \n* Lengthening the runway from 9 months to 24 months  \nWith a slightly lower infrastructure budget and trading speed improvements for longevity, we've prioritized keeping the lights on for as long as possible. In these 24 months of budget to cover basic infrastructure costs, we hope to get an API up and running so that we can fund future development. The cost of that development is NOT part of this grant.

Emphasizing open, agile methodologies, we engage with the community for feedback, enhancing the decentralized governance of the DAO, the Governance dApp, and its ecosystem. See **[how the platform looked back in January ‘22](https://web.archive.org/web/20211228134526/https://governance.decentraland.org/)** when we started developing it and how it looks now to understand the value delivered by our team.\n\nFor this Grant period, following community input on Core Unit's Grant proposals recently, we’ve **decided to cut our budget by 25%.** This decision stems from the recent downturn in the crypto and metaverse markets. While the situation is improving, **we believe in building efficiently during this market conditions to prepare for the next bull run**. Additionally, **the Governance platform has reached a level of maturity** that allows us to optimize our workload. Our focus now will be on implementing binding community decisions, improving existing features, maintaining critical platform aspects (like security and third-party integrations), and introducing some new features.\n\nA team like us must exist to ensure the continuity, decentralization, and security of the DAO ops but at this point, the effort is not the same as it was so **charging the DAO for the same workload that we had in the past looked unfair**. **The team will maintain all the current responsibilities** towards the community and in the future might look into other promising projects in the ecosystem.\n\nThe team will follow [agile development practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to ensure a lean implementation of DAO governance requirements and continuous improvement of such features. The team will update the community via Project Updates, gather feedback using Canny, and answer questions at the open DAO Town Hall meetings and Discord server. Monthly Demo recordings will be provided as well.\n\nThe same Grant operational conditions detailed in the [original founding proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) still apply and the grant will be provided as a vesting contract in DAI assigned to 2-out-of-3 signatures [wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698/transactions/history). \n\nCheck our [changelog](https://github.com/decentraland/governance/releases), our recorded [demos](https://www.notion.so/840079520e8742d0be9fa07bf2fe60f7?pvs=21), and the last project update with **a recap of all things shipped in the previous 6 months** [here](https://decentraland.org/governance/update/?id=7e3483f5-3b99-11ee-9496-2daa447e4bf3).

Instead of focusing on a highly entertaining experience, we concentrate on providing players with sufficient incentives, diverse routes to obtain the incentives, and a fair system to encourage prolonged participation. Simultaneously, we guide players to explore promotional materials for brands, increasing exposure and their willingness to participate in our experience.

It includes a customizable AI character, multilingual interaction capabilities, and diverse backend setups compatible with various LLMs like OpenAI and Open Source Models. Key tools such as MemGPT and AutoGen enhance AI character detailing and interaction.\n\nThe system's use cases are versatile, covering virtual guides in Decentraland for navigation and information, interactive storytelling and roleplay, AI companions for social interaction, innovative educational modules, and AI-driven customer service representatives, decorations, quests, audio & speech features.\n\nProgress from the last proposal:\n\n1.

Atlas Analytics often catches data and users that data sources dependent on Catalyst Nodes do not, and can paint a more complete picture of user traffic in one’s virtual world.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are currently the only provider of such a service in most of the metaverse. Other platforms, such as Roblox, offer these services to their builders and we believe Decentraland needs to retain similar offerings to remain competitive. \n\nLast week we reached out to @Yemel to discuss this topic, and he agreed on the value the platform provides the community. The Foundation is not currently planning on building such a service; any analytics collected today are in support of Foundation engineering teams to improve the product and not at providing metrics and KPIs for users. \n\nOne of the goals of this project is to make this product more sustainable; we don’t want to be reaching out to the DAO for more funding in perpetuity. Instead, we think of the DAO more as a government - spending the equivalent of your “taxes” on initiatives that add value to a community but where capitalism may fail to deliver because of high barriers to entry. The local Mom n’ Pop shop may not have the ability to finance the interstate highway that would increase traffic to their destination. An individual is not going to pioneer a space program (and even when a billionaire does build their own rocket ships they are often still heavily subsidized by the local government).\n\nWe also have never, and will continue to never sell any user data. We do not consider that a viable path to profitability as it compromises the values and ethics of the community.\n\nThis grant seeks to accomplish the following:\n* Open source the code, making it the property of the community. Anyone will be able to take the code and run the platform.\n* Operate the service for another year. While the code will be open source, to operate at the scale of all of Decentraland it currently requires $5k/month of infrastructure and is expected to grow over the course of the year with increased adoption and usage.\n* Enhance the product, alongside the community publishing out in the open, to include:\n* Worlds analytics\n* Official support for SDK 7 \n* Additional content and tutorials to help new creators onboard and understand the full breadth of capabilities.\n* Running focus groups to determine how to paywall to make the solution more sustainable, and provide the highest impact new features for the community\n* Bringing the platform in line with other metaverse analytics offerings so that Decentraland can remain competitive\n\nTo express their commitment to the above, Yemel has pledged that the foundation will become an “enterprise” client, and will be supplementing the funds contributed by the DAO.

We onboard them and provide support along the way. The team participated in governance processes updating the grants program, developed a grants landing page, published articles to showcase grants, provided transparency in public roadmaps, launched initiatives such as Testing Sessions, sent welcome kits to strengthen DCL brand awareness, and published a Manual of Operations. We have also created a Revocations Committee (RC), and so far we have recovered  $433.778 DAI since this squad was created.\n\n**The GSS has been active and working under 3 main goals:**\n\n**1) For taking care of DAO Treasury**: [$433.778 has been recovered](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/edfd964a496942d4befa74d22f4ae26d?v=177d8ed6010f4efd9e96f8f14e7cf5a3&pvs=4). \nBefore establishing the RC, were our squad revoked vesting contracts based on gather information, engaging with the grantee, and seeking inputs from advisors to confirm or refute our findings. This approach served as a double-check on the information available. After nearly a year of following this procedure, our team and the community began to recognize that it concentrated a significant amount of power within a single entity. As a response to this concern, the RC was established through a governance proposal. Its purpose was to review our recommendations and allow grantees to engage with an impartial third party, thus ensuring a more fair and transparent process. In this stage, funds related to 8 projects were revoked or recovered, totaling $291,330 (all made possible thanks to investigations or interventions by the GSS) and 13 cases were dismissed.\n\n**2) For supporting grantees**, we have onboarded 100% of the grantees that entered the Program. On our last renewal, while providing more than **784 hours of support**, we shipped more than 45 onboarding kits to raise brand awareness. Since the squad was created, we have solved more than **128 problems/requests** to lead grants to success. So far, we have also produced **20 articles**, published in the DCL Blog about the work our grantees are doing. More recently we have launched **Testing Sessions**, to give the grantees a space to demo their projects and get feedback. So far we have **hosted 27 sessions**.\n\n**3) For fostering transparency & accountability**, we have launched Public Roadmaps, to make a follow up on grants milestones and impact metrics to 100% of the projects (Grants' Framework 2023). We are proud of having built a grants program with community input, with 16 step-by-step guides to provide transparency about our work: [Grant Support Squad’s manual of operations](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Grant-Support-Squad-Documentation-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f). We've also created the [DAO Grants Github REPO](https://github.com/Decentraland-DAO/grants) to compile all the available codes from open sourced grants.\n\nAnd to make overall updates and changes to the grants program, we have published 11 governance proposals,  and have done 9 pull requests made into docs.decentraland.org to update the Grants Program documentation. We have written security recommendations, and a sensitive data handling policy and we created the [Grants Program Landing Page](https://dao.decentraland.org/grants/) . \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0TNgMW15zxQupKUVQUmYKTBNIzAn5g929kRuLInc4Q/edit?usp=sharing)  you can see our financial report (Jun to Nov23).

Our journey began with the mission to create a public registry of individuals and organizations offering their services to build content on Decentraland's platform. The aim was to provide transparency to brands looking for talented builders for event productions, wearables, 3D modeling, and SDK programming. This initiative was born out of the desire to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new business opportunities for creators within the Decentraland community. See our first grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81af5b00-02e6-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f).\n\nOur [second grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81283aa0-b946-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986) focused on creating business opportunities for our verified studios. We launched the Jobs feature streamlining job opportunities for Decentraland creators and we ran performance marketing campaigns to generate leads.\n\nThe [third grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5f962e70-22ef-11ee-8ace-3bf098daeebe) we focused on enhancing the user experience by improving communication between studios and brands. To achieve this, we are introducing a dashboard and a messaging system, facilitating seamless interaction.\n\nNow, with this fourth grant, we enter a new phase. Our focus is on the platform's maintenance mode with minimal resources, ensuring its operation for future market opportunities. \n\nThe historical context and achievements have brought us to this point, where we must sustain the valuable resource we have created for the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nOver the past months:\n\n- A total of 48 job posts.\n- 9 of these job posts have generated a total revenue of $43,320 for 10 different studios (shared voluntarily by some posters).\n- 10 job posts have been moderated.\n\nFor this grant, we kindly request the community support to ensure the sustainability and growth of Decentraland Studios.

Now almost 2 years running, we’ve consistently hosted live performances every Tuesday and Thursday, featuring over 95 unique artists (and counting) from across the world.\n\nTo manage the Inn's operations, we have developed custom solutions, including a customized streaming server, attendance tracking system, NFT distribution tools, artist management tooling, triggerable animations, and periodic remodeling of our 3D venue, all of which contribute to enhancing the visitor experience.\n\nBuilding upon the success of our digital performances, we embarked to expand our operations by [organizing in-person parties in Amsterdam every other Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFq37P-N3o), which we have been doing since last November. Collaborating with a local venue, we seamlessly integrate live DJ performances with decentraland projected behind the DJ, allowing our audience to immerse themselves in a hybrid entertainment experience.

While this self-reliant approach has been sustainable thus far, we are seeking external funding to facilitate our growth and streamline our operations throughout the remainder of 2023 and into the early months of 2024.

Dedicated, long-time Decentralites who have waited in vain for essential documentation have already begun to leave. Current documentation is inconsistent and incomplete. It takes a long time to track down relevant, current and functional information. Decentral Ed, Canessa and AwedJob, with 18 years of teaching experience combined, will help more people faster, and more effectively with up-to-date information located in one place, and updated frequently. \n\nDecentral Ed will look at existing public questions, and we will ask people about their gaps in understanding during twice monthly “DEd Reckoning” sessions (“open knowledge” discussions held in the DEd.dcl.eth world using DCL Cast) to find out what people need to know. We will then create documentation addressing these topics. \n\nWe will deliver subject specific, cross-standard, information in text form located in one authoritative place. An online document can be more easily updated and maintained than a soon to be outdated “how to video”. Our documents may also be printed, making them readily available when you are away from your computer as well. Text is easily queried, referenced, and digested by search engines and large language model A.I.\n\nDecentral Ed will separate documents into three standards, update them regularly, and ensure their accuracy. These standards are: Governance, Social and Development. We will write documentation for people at the novice and advanced beginner levels. These are the first two of five different skill levels: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. We feel that there is an existing body of proficient and expert level documentation. We will not be creating documentation for those top two skill levels.\n\nDecentral Ed will produce a minimum of 200 documents over the course of 2,000 work hours during a period of ten months. The subject matter for these documents will come from DEd Reckoning sessions and from existing unanswered questions found on Discord servers, Reddit posts, GitHub repos, and StackOverflow posts. We will fill existing gaps like “how to rotate a scene in SDK7” and “Deploying multiple video screens from one m3u8 video stream.” The “DEd Reckoning” sessions will begin as twice monthly sessions but may increase to twice weekly sessions as schedules allow. These will be streamed live inside DEd.dcl.eth using DCL Cast, streamed to Kick, and uploaded to YouTube for archival purposes.\n\nBy the time we submitted our proposal in the third quarter, there were other, previously submitted proposals in the Documentation category. With their passage the remaining budget for this category was $9,000. Our proposal was therefore considered outside of budget. This proposal is our re-submission at the start of the fourth quarter.

These clients will be tailored for Android and iOS platforms, with the potential for publication on the App Store and Play Store. This expansion aims to make Decentraland more accessible to a wider audience, providing a seamless and immersive experience on mobile devices.\n- **Bevy Desktop Client Development**: In the short term, we will continue the development of the Decentraland Bevy engine's desktop client. By doing so, we indirectly contribute to the Godot project, as both engines share the Rust language, common goals, and development principles. This effort ensures that Decentraland has a robust desktop client, positioning it for future deployment on various desktop platforms.\n\n### Secondary Objectives:\n- **User Experience Enhancement**: Central to our approach is prioritizing the user experience. We aim to create a user-friendly environment in which casual users can interact seamlessly with Web3, all without the need to manage a self-custodial wallet. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing user engagement within the virtual world, refining elements such as player locomotion, emotes, and other interactive features.\n- **Test scenes**: Test scenes will be developed by our team to ensure the compatibility, completeness, and uniformity of SDK7 implementation across all the clients.\n- **Documentation and Collaboration**: We are committed to maintaining and enhancing Decentraland's documentation. This includes contributions to documentation repositories and working closely with the Decentraland Foundation to address any unfinished tasks. Our goal is to ensure that users and developers have access to comprehensive and up-to-date resources for utilizing Decentraland's features and protocols.\n- **SDK7 Enrichment** : We will actively participate in the growth and improvement of SDK7. Our contributions will involve refining the SDK, adding new features, and ensuring its compatibility with our client developments, thereby fostering a thriving Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, our proposal outlines a multifaceted approach to elevate Decentraland's metaverse experience. By expanding to mobile platforms with Godot, continuing Bevy's desktop client development, and focusing on user-centric enhancements, we aim to make Decentraland more accessible, engaging, and immersive for users and developers alike. Our commitment to documentation, collaboration, and SDK7 growth further solidifies Decentraland's position as a leading decentralized virtual world.\n\nNote: A new Staff Engineer was added to the proposal (in comparison with the previous one: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5d65f080-4eab-11ee-8775-751cfef3aca1) that will help with the Performance of the Mobile Version, and he's adding the possibility of doing a PoC of VR and an Experimental version for Web.

By providing a reliable source of historical information, it minimizes the risk of misinformation, ensuring that users can trust the platform and its development processes.\n\n**Educational Resource:** \nThe documentation becomes a valuable educational resource. Researchers, enthusiasts, stakeholders, and newcomers can access a well-preserved history, gaining insights into Decentraland's unique journey. \n\n**Support for Decentralized Governance:**\nIn a digital realm where decentralized governance and ownership are paramount, information preservation serves as a fundamental pillar. It empowers the community to make informed decisions based on historical context, contributing to the platform's continued success.\n\n**Promotion of Innovation:**\nBy acknowledging the intrinsic value of historical documentation, this project promotes innovation within Decentraland. It encourages a deeper understanding of the platform's past, which can inspire future developments and creative endeavors.\n\nThis project ensures that Decentraland's history remains intact and accessible to all, enriching the platform's culture and providing a solid foundation for its future.

However, a significant challenge lies in the differences between tools and creation languages. While GLTF is gaining traction, it's not as widely supported as established formats like FBX.\n\nGLTF's incompatibility with popular engines like Unity, along with its technical complexity, presents a steep learning curve. This makes it hard for new users to begin, as they must learn a new format and workflow. While tools like Blender are useful for initial visual work, they have limitations when it comes to scene organization.\n\n**Creating a Smooth Path Ahead**\n\nOur project tackles this challenge directly, putting artists in the spotlight. Our goal is to remove obstacles and empower creators with a tool that follows industry standards used in gaming and film. This tool makes scene creation exceptionally easy from the start\n\n**Solving Development Challenges with Ease**\n\nWe utilize Unity, a powerful 3D engine. Our tool simplifies design and seamlessly integrates with Decentraland SDK7, making it effortless to create Decentraland projects with 3D objects, materials, textures, and animations.\n\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal_01.png \"\")\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal_02.png \"\")\n\n**Enhancing Developmental Value**\n\nTo simplify the process, our scene translator creates reusable code fragments. These code pieces enable interactions like links, animations, and the addition of sounds, videos, and NFTs. As development continues, the code adapts to include new SDK features, providing a dynamic platform for innovation.\n\n**An Oasis of Expertise**\n\nWith over three years of experience in Decentraland, [Polygonal Mind](https://studios.decentraland.org/profile/polygonal-mind) has gained deep technical knowledge. Our portfolio includes projects like  **Doritos**, **Megacube**, **MtnDew**, Boson Protocol, **MOMUS Park**, and **Automatic Slims**, among others. These projects show our ability to create immersive Metaverse experiences by blending art and code. We built them using a tool we developed for SDK6, showing our confidence in our work.\n\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal_05.png )\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal_06.jpg )\n\n**Embracing Collaboration**\n\nAs supporters of open-source principles, we aim to provide clear documentation and easy access to our project. Our goal is to encourage participation, making sure this tool remains a shared resource that can grow through both our efforts and community contributions. We aim to ensure the tool stays valuable as the platform evolves with new features.\n\n**A Vision for the Future**\n\nThis grant is a big step in our journey to build a better editor. We hope the community likes our work as much as our team does. In simple terms, we want to make it easier to be creative in Decentraland. We're working to remove obstacles, boost creativity, and change how virtual worlds are made. With your support, we're opening the door to a future where imagination has no limits.","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Core Development","duration":4,"aboutThis":"Payment of workers, equipment and other related running costs to the development by Polygonal Mind.

We have taken the time to listen to the community's feedback and have worked hard to refine our 2D model while also developing the 3D version of the game.\n\nWe recently imported our game into WebGL, The community wanted the game to be directly accessible on DCL without a frame. As a result, we have made adjustments to our approach and have imported WebGL on a separate page but are working on a 3D game mode in DCL aswell.\n\nWe have also implemented a data storage system using PlayFab that enables players to make progress in either the 2D or 3D game, and it will carry over to the other platform. We believe that this feature will be a significant asset to the game and add value to the player experience.\n\nWe have a webpage for our proposal active for this proposal and will share a document with fundamentals.\n\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant-proposal\n\n**Contributing to Decentraland's Growth:**\n\nAdditionally, we aim to contribute to the growth and success of the Decentraland platform. Our game will bring increased engagement and activity to the platform, and our data storage and crossover system will set a new standard for games on the platform.\n\n**Experienced Team:**\n\nOur team has the necessary skills and experience to make Duel Arena a success, and we are committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our project deserves funding because of its unique features, potential benefits, and alignment with the vision and mission of the Decentraland platform.\n\n**Progress Made:**\n\nWhile we have made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena for the Decentraland platform, it's important to note that the 3D game is not yet finished. However, we have created a 2D game that is currently live and playable on itch.io. We have designed the 2D game to serve as a demo for the 3D game and showcase some of the features and content that we plan to include.\n\n**Battleground Map:**\n\nDespite the 3D game being a work in progress, we have made significant strides in its development, as outlined in the previous section. Our team is confident in our ability to complete the development of Duel Arena and deliver a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We have also developed a unique battleground map that is set on a floating platform above the 3D game map.\n\n**Functional Buttons and Wearables:**\n\nFurthermore, we have created several UI buttons such as Play 2D, Home, and Play Now. We have also developed functional buttons for gathering resources, including wood, fire, dandelions, and water. Winning battles will give players game currency that can be used to purchase wearable NFTs that give bonuses in-game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur team has made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena and is committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our game has the potential to contribute to the growth and success of the platform, and we are excited to continue our work on this project.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0i6oZgi","paymentToken":"DAI","inWorldContent":{"totalUsers":2000,"totalPieces":3,"engagementMeasurement":"We are going to check our registered Users, See how High we score in the explorer tab & We are going to check on  Returning Users.\n\n**How?**\n\nMetrics based on the data provided & calculated by PlayFab our Database in Microsoft Azure.\nWe are going to do collaboration events where people outside of Decentraland will get onboarded and they have their own analytics."},"budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Game Development","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This will cover the cost of hiring a skilled game developer who will be responsible for coding the game mechanics, designing and implementing the UI/UX, and testing and refining the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":26000},{"concept":"Graphic Designer","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Our game designer will work on to create the 3D game assets, the 2D game assets, and all visual elements of the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":18500},{"concept":"Sound Designer","duration":6,"aboutThis":"We will hire a sound designer to create and implement sound effects and background music for the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1000},{"concept":"Marketing And Advertising","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This will cover the cost of marketing and advertising campaigns to raise awareness and generate interest in Duel Arena.

Those contributions include some of the largest weekly gatherings in DCL, serving as an entry point for many metaverse music fans, and writing the blueprint for dozens of artists and DJs to follow. A grant from the Decentraland DAO will help StoneyEye develop greater opportunities in the art and music spaces of DCL, while also bringing additional web2 producers and musicians into Decentraland. These efforts will be conducted with the goal of increasing new users in DCL and improving user retention.","category":"In-World Content","beneficiary":"0x082f2A8ea1D8E3ee24c20d12452B7E851ad0D5DD","description":"Stoney’s ability to engage with DCL audiences results in an environment that has become synonymous with Decentraland performances–quality music combined with social engagement, both in-world and on social platforms. The rapid growth of music communities in DCL can be traced from his first residency at Parcel Party, which became a must-attend weekly event for many users. Beginning in November, 2021, a Stoney event has been on the calendar nearly every week, including the addition of MoFyah Mondays at the TRU Band Room and MoBeatz every-other Sunday. During a period with decreased attendance across much of Decentraland, Stoney has continued to generate good-sized audiences, which benefits other DCL projects and creators by creating a reliable, consistent pathway into DCL for new users.\n\nPrior to his time in Decentraland, Stoney began his career as a successful recording/touring musician and producer, sharing the stage with numerous A-list acts. His experience in the greater world of music provides an invaluable education for independent musicians entering web3. The melding of art, music, social content, and community engagement is what creates the unique environment of DCL music. In addition to presenting his own music, Stoney has collaborated with several other musicians and DJs in the space, furthering the strength of bond in metaverse music. As brands and investors look to Decentraland as a viable platform for messaging and events, the community fostered by DCL musicians becomes even more important by providing consistent engagement opportunities.\n\nIn addition to music, Stoney also contributes to visual arts and design in Decentraland. He is a prolific artist and wearable creator, who consistently contributes forward-thinking designs to help highlight DCL. His hand-drawn art has appeared on dozens of event attendance tokens, increasing the value proposition of attending his shows. Late last year, Stoney began MoBeatz, an interactive event, during which a piece of music is created live. In collaboration with DCL community members, these “beats” are minted and airdropped to all attendees. This innovative approach to user engagement provides an opportunity to engage with prominent music producers, which again provides a compelling reason for new users to enter Decentraland.\n\nFunding from the Decentraland DAO will help establish the framework for artist self-sufficiency in the metaverse. In addition to upgrading equipment, building a long-term social engagement events strategy, this grant will build on the existing mentorship opportunities already provided by Stoney. This education will bring more musicians, artists, and producers to DCL, increasing attendance and showcasing the strength of community. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1658561199846600704   TRU Band Room- Mo Fyah Monday\nhttps://twitter.com/fermion_dcl_eth/status/1516926795945283584    Parcel Party- Magic Hour\nhttps://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1622575622852866049  Mo Beatz\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV0hTqTcRg  Metazoo\n\nNote- This proposal is for one year's worth of work in 6 months of payment","paymentToken":"DAI","inWorldContent":{"totalUsers":6000,"totalPieces":76,"engagementMeasurement":"By data collected from TRU SHOAPs and from information from https://dcl-metrics.com/\n\nView all StoneyEye SHOAPs here:\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/tru-shoap?search[stringTraits][0][name]=Performer&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=StoneyEye&search[stringTraits][0][values][1]=Stoney%20Eye&search[stringTraits][0][values][2]=Stoney%20Eye%2C%20Mr.Swe&search[stringTraits][0][values][3]=StoneyEye%2C%20Krooked%20Treez"},"budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"New Equipment ","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Computer with video and audio capabilities     $4000\nMouse $100\nKeyboard  $100\nNew monitor     $500\nInterface   $1000\nMonitor controller   $300 \nLights & stands $1500\nCamera $1500\nStream Deck $150\nMidi Keyboard controller $500 \nMic $400\nMic arm 2x $200\nDAW Ableton live $750\n\nTotal $11,000\n","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":11000},{"concept":"Producers","duration":6,"aboutThis":"To pay and onboard producers and musicians with an established following with the goal of gaining new users and bringing attention to Decentraland, as well as pay our community members to guest produce.

This project will get people: in-world, building, and having fun as quickly and easily as possible. Let’s proudly use Decentraland to build Decentraland, in Decentraland.\n\nTo date, the Foundation has created the web Builder Tool, and 3rd party companies / individuals have created their own standalone editors and builders. At one point, The Foundation built an in-world builder too! Unfortunately, it was a release of an unfinished product; the 3rd party software and services are not ‘inside’ DCL (limiting their accessibility and usability) and require an external website and/or external software package.\n","category":"Platform","platform":{"impactMetrics":"We hope to create the easiest to use, most fun building experience inside the Decentraland platform."},"beneficiary":"0xe96f1c6B08b1d932Df11E78A040a75B546ab8d2B","description":"https://vimeo.com/user156016949/iwb - competition\n\nThis proposal’s goal is to make creating content within Decentraland as user-friendly and accessible as other mainstream gaming platforms. Today, creating and building quality content within DCL has a high barrier to entry, thus restricting DCL’s potential user and creator base to a more limited highly trained and technically advanced audience (or to those who can afford to pay). If broader adoption and sustainable user growth is to be achieved, the current state needs to be changed. As it stands, more user friendly and quite frankly more basic metaverses (such as Roblox) lead to user adoption for this reason.\n\nThis new In World Builder will be easy to use, require no coding, and require no deploying. Users will have immediate access to a catalog of thousands of assets, the ability to add, remove, transform assets, and the ability to upload custom assets. Most importantly it will aid DCL’s development by reducing the current barrier to entry for many creators, making DCL accessible for creators of all skill levels (and budgets). \nNo code, no deploy, real time collaboration. Better builder, functionality, and assets.\n\nThe In World Builder will be a seamless, integrated ‘in-world’ building experience, deployed by way of a multi-tiered strategy that offers DCL users the following key features:\n\n- Everything in world: Build inside Decentraland for Decentraland.\n- No Code, No Deploy: Easy drag & drop functionality.\n- Upload Custom Assets\n-  Enhanced Interactive Components: IFTTT style builder for smart items.\n-  Multiplayer: Real-time, collaborative, social building sessions.\n- Import/Export Scenes: Save scene creations for future deployment.\n- Accessibility: Wallet free building & saving.\n- Rewards by participation: Gamification of building.\n- New Pathways and interactions: Developed & diverse collaborative building experience.\n\n\nAs part of this proposal, we also plan to introduce over 2000 new assets of various types including textures, audio files, animations, smart items, and functions grouped in exciting new themes. The new assets will enhance creativity and encourage more users to get involved in the building process. Regular ‘creator’ sessions will allow new users to learn how to best utilize the builder for their own creations. This In World Builder solution will stimulate and support sustainable creativity, establish new pathways and interactions, and significantly benefit the Decentraland platform and its users and creators.\n\n### Multi-tier Strategy\n- Part 1: The In World Builder Tool\n- Part 2: The Community Development Plaza (or Dev Plaza) - We plan to receive deployment rights to one of the duplicate Genesis City plazas. This new ‘Community Development Plaza’ (CDP) will be a central location for highlighting user builds created with the In World Builder tool. Think of the current scene pool on the Builder website but deployed in-world.\n\n### Tech Stack\n#### Atlas Corp. World Server \nEnterprise level World Server from Atlas Corp. Build in world, deploy to Genesis City.\n\n#### Microsoft Playfab \nA robust suite of services. It allows the IWB to track players, save data and create inventories, items, currencies, and analytics, all within a secure infrastructure built on Microsoft Azure\n\n#### Colyseus Multiplayer Architecture\nAllows us to represent everyone’s “live building” in real time, to each DCL user.

However, the current documentation system primarily supports text-based learning, leaving visual and kinesthetic learners at a disadvantage when attempting to learn more about the space. \n\nMy proposal aims to bridge this gap by developing visual and detailed posters that illustrate the complexities of the Decentraland DAO in an engaging and visual manner.\n\nWhy This Project Should Receive Funding:\n\n**Enhancing Accessibility**: Visual documentation will make the Decentraland DAO more accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer visual learning as opposed to detailed, text-based learning. This increased accessibility may lead to greater community engagement and participation in the long term.\n\n**Improving Understanding**: By transforming complex text into clear visual representations, the posters can foster a better understanding of how the Decentraland DAO functions, and may inadvertently lead to better decision-making from the DAO in the long-term. This may lead to the empowerment of users, who can be comfortable interacting with the platform with greater confidence.\n\n**Supporting Educational Initiatives**: These visual aids could become essential educational tools for newcomers, developers, and educators alike, supporting a variety of learning preferences and needs.\n\n**Brand-Themed Content**: This visual content is also useful material for our social media channels to explain and promote our current structures, which will be useful content for several different platforms.\n\nProblems That This Project Will Solve\n\n**Complexity Barrier**: The inadvertent complexity of Decentraland's DAO can be intimidating to new users. Visual aids can actively break down these barriers and make DCL-focused information far more digestible to the average DCL user.\n\n**Lack of Diverse Learning Resources**: Currently, DCL's documentation is tailored mainly for those who learn best through reading. By incorporating visual learning, this project will satisfy the needs of diverse learning styles.\n\nBenefits to the Decentraland Platform\n\n**Increased Community Engagement**: More comprehensible and appealing resources may attract more users to engage with the platform, growing the Decentraland community.\n\n**Strengthened Governance**: By improving understanding and accessibility, more community members may feel empowered to participate in governance, thereby enriching the democratic process within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**Boosting Educational Outreach**: These visual resources can be leveraged for workshops, tutorials, and other educational initiatives set up by both the DAO and the Foundation; strengthening Decentraland's position as a leader in virtual world technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis project is not just about adding new content; it is about making Decentraland more inclusive, accessible, and understandable. By funding this project, we can take a significant step towards building Decentraland-focused documentation that resonates with all types of learners, reinforcing its place as a pioneering platform in the virtual world industry.","paymentToken":"DAI","documentation":{"contentType":", Documentation Article","totalPieces":50},"budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Lead Designer","duration":1,"aboutThis":"This budget allocation shall cover the foreseen costs of working on over 50 designs related to Decentraland's DAO over a 3 month period. \n\nThis fee covers the ideation phase, the designing phase, and community-oriented communication and feedback.

In addition, we encourage training for new creators, SDKs, and modelers, creating help groups where more experienced individuals offer support and guidance to beginners, sharing their knowledge and skills to help others grow and develop.\n\nAs the community grows and evolves, new talent is discovered and supported in their creative journeys. Through carefully planned actions and opportunities, the community is turning dreams into reality and cultivating a vibrant culture of creativity and innovation. Because we believe that everyone has unique skills and talents that deserve to be valued and supported, we work to promote actions that generate personalized opportunities for each individual, according to their skills and interests.\nDuring this period, the team’s salary and the community’s projects were financed solely by the Founder’s personal budget. Some initiatives were taken, such as the purchase of land that today houses the headquarters of DCL Brazil, whose coordinates are (-107, -94). In addition, a community T-shirt was published, with free distribution to all members and interested parties.\nTwelve wearables were also created in collaboration with other members of the platform.

Unfavorable publicity by social media influencers has the potential to disturb the percentage of conversions among the general public engaging with the Decentraland platform. Inaccurate details and uncertainty could lead to skepticism related to the platform's value proposition as we can see with Folding Idea’s YouTube Video “The Future is a Dead Mall - Decentraland and the Metaverse”\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZhdpLXZ8Q&t=2789s) This is one example, in which an influencer has surgically crafted a video to increase fear, uncertainty, doubt which results in misinformation. The Blockchain Social aim’s to create content which combats the negative PR, and present to the  populace the true marvels of Decentraland.\n\nSolution-\n* Blockchain Social will create and produce content to tackle unfavorable perceptions of Decentraland. This can assist in showcasing the true wonders of what Decentraland has to offer. Through creating high-grade, high-quality material, our goal is to draw in unique visitors. In addition, we strive to highlight the work efforts of different communities within this space such as Wilderness, Elo Chess Club, DecentralGames, Mo Beatz, Decentraland Worlds, etc. The information will emphasize the distinctive characteristics of the platform, user interactions, and options for participation.\n\nBenefits-\n* Improved Conversion Rates: Blockchain Social will combat negative PR by creating positive engaging content throughout all social media platforms. Through this effort, the team confidently believes it will boost conversion rates in Decentraland by resolving uncertainties and showcasing the platform's value offerings. \n\n* Enhanced Reputation: By creating high-quality organic material, Blockchain Social strives to boost Decentraland's image among the Web3 ecosystem. This will present Decentraland as trustworthy , dependable, and will attract more high-quality users to the platform by promoting positive narratives and countering negative PR.\n\n* Empowering Women in Web3: Blockchain Social is dedicated to backing women in business within the Web3 network. In alignment with our objective, we will provide dedicated support, guidance, and connection opportunities to empower women in the Web 3 domain. In addition, we will  expand these initiatives beyond Decentraland to the larger Web3 domain by “cross pollinating” which will foster a supportive environment for women entrepreneurs. \n\nIn addition, the team aims to create at a minimum 20 engaging posts, 30 instagram stories, 10 videos, and 4 blog posts (400 word minimum) a month to recap events occurring throughout Decentraland, which will serve as a unique repository of amazing events that happen throughout the year.

Our aim is to bring a new level of creative freedom and active participation for the users in Decentraland, taking advantage of the vast possibilities of the Decentraland.\n\nThe core of Dhingia HQ is the innovative crafting system we've developed. Here's how it works: Users can gather resources, which we call \"Craftons,\" from specific areas designated for harvesting resources within the HQ. Once they've collected Craftons, they can use our crafting machines to transform these resources into customised 3D builds, unique wearables, or personalised 1/1 Dhingia-Build Passes. The crafting machines come in different types, from basic to more complex, with upgraded versions available as users progress. \n\nThe items users can create with the Craftons are varied and diverse, ranging from common items to extremely rare ones. This means users can add unique aesthetic touches to their Decentraland experience. The rarer the materials users gather and the more they experiment with combinations, the higher the value of the items they can craft.\n\nBut Dhingia HQ is more than just a place to craft items. It's an engaging space designed to enhance user interaction and exploration. We've got different areas designated for various activities: there are spaces to gather materials, hubs for crafting, areas with interactive puzzles and obstacle courses that reward users with prizes. To help users navigate and make the most of these areas, we'll have AI guides providing insights about digital architecture, crafting, and more. \nWe will also create a Builder’s workshop, which is designed as a hub for all Decentraland builders, both experienced and aspiring. Here, they can gather to share ideas, learn from each other, and have meaningful discussions about architectural designs, virtual builds, and other related topics.\n\nBeyond crafting and exploring, Dhingia HQ will also serve as a vibrant hub for Decentraland's community and culture. We're planning to customise and create new thematic builds on the HQ for every major festival and event in Decentraland. We have excecuted this during the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week 2023 (can check it out here - https://www.mrdhingia.com/post/dhingia-fashion-buzz-at-mvfw23-decentraland ), and it was a huge success. The event saw high engagement levels and positive feedback from the community, and we're convinced that Dhingia HQ can be a key venue for celebrating the metaverse's shared events and milestones.\n\nMoreover, to keep the spirit of competition and achievement alive, we plan on hosting in-game tournaments. These tournaments will include various tasks and challenges, and winners will be rewarded with MANA, Mythic wearables, and other exciting prizes. This will not only encourage more user interaction but also contribute to the overall vibrancy and dynamism of Decentraland.\n\nLastly, our Dhingia-Build Passes add another dimension to user creativity. Users can craft these passes to commission custom builds for their personal use from Dhingia Builds, allowing them to leave their unique imprint on the Decentraland landscape.\n\nOverall, our vision for Dhingia HQ is a user-centric, dynamic space that enhances the Decentraland experience by offering the opportunity to craft, explore, and celebrate the metaverse's shared events.","paymentToken":"DAI","inWorldContent":{"totalUsers":30000,"totalPieces":100,"engagementMeasurement":"We will measure engagement by tracking various metrics such as the number of builds, wearables, and build passes crafted, the participation rate in tournaments, the attendance at events, and the number of attendees at workshops.

The goal is to foster an attractive environment for expert developers.\n\nThe importance of having an editor capable of accommodating professionals and more importantly non-coders cannot be overstated. It is crucial for gaining traction and attracting a diverse user base to the Decentraland platform.

While this was ok in the initial stages, the process is quite cumbersome.\n\nWe aim to streamline this by introducing a workflow that enables users to log in with MetaMask and sign the deployment within the app. This means that, once your changes are finalized, you can deploy your scene with just a click.\n\n## Enhanced Content Discovery\nThough we currently have a tool that scrapes catalyst for scene data, it's not very useful. We intend to add a page to 2dcl's web that lists all the deployed scenes. This list, including the name, description, screenshot, and parcel details, would be available for anyone interested.\n\nWe plan to incorporate this list within the 2dcl explorer. The list will be updated at least once a day. We will also provide an RSS feed for users to track scene updates.\n\n## Streamlined Login\nWhile we offer an automatic 3D to 2D avatar conversion, the process currently involves editing a config file. This can be simplified.\n\nWe'll make this process more user-friendly with a login workflow. The goal is to allow users to get their avatars up and running with just a few clicks.\n\n## Experimentation\n\nA FAQ is whether one can see or communicate with others in 2dcl. Unfortunately, the answer is no. We hope to change this by implementing the required endpoints in our catalyst client library and exploring the use of Worlds to unite all 2dcl users.","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Scene Deployment & Login","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Design and implementation of both workflows","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":10000},{"concept":"Content Discovery Database","duration":1,"aboutThis":"We will create a web-based list of content and incorporate it into the client.

During our last grant, we launched the Jobs feature, which listed 14+ new commercial projects for our community, and drove 20.000+ unique visitors to our platform.\n\nFor this grant, our main goals are:\n\n**1. Maintain platform operations:**\n\nWe will ensure a smooth operation by addressing user inquiries, onboarding new studios, and staying connected with Decentraland's ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to overseeing [studios.decentraland.org](http://studios.decentraland.org/), Discord, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcl_studios), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/decentraland_studios/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/decentraland-studios).\n\n**2. Enhance User Experience:**\n\n2.1 Improvements to [Jobs](https://studios.decentraland.org/) feature:\nNowadays, brands (aka “customers” in this proposal) are unable to see their projects after they post them to our platform. Also, communication between studios and brands happens exclusively via email. Even though our MVP was intended to work like this, we are aware of its limitations:\n\n- Brands can’t directly manage their projects, especially if they post more than one project simultaneously\n- Brands have a hard time tracking their communication with each studio that offers to collaborate with them\n\nBecause of this, we will develop a dashboard for potential clients to monitor and manage the job opportunities they create and a messaging system that will facilitate communication between studios and brands. These two features will allow brands to easily manage and keep track of their project's status. By improving the brands’ experience in our platform we are looking to make them returning users, thus growing the number of job opportunities for studios.\n\n2.2 Improvements to [resources](https://studios.decentraland.org/resources), [projects](https://studios.decentraland.org/projects) and [studio profiles](https://studios.decentraland.org/profile/amaixin)\n\nWe will improve the UI for Resources making them easier to understand before opening them on GitHub. We will add filter and sorting functionalities to the projects view, allowing users to find projects that are relevant to them. We will also improve the studios' profiles to better showcase their skills and talent. This includes adding a messaging system so that users can contact studios easily.\n\n**3. Generate leads:**\n\nCreate performance marketing campaigns in web2 platforms such as Linkedin, Twitter, Google, and Instagram targeted to brand owners and marketers interested in building a presence in the Metaverse. We are not requesting a budget for this task, as we still have a ~15.000 DAI surplus from our previous grant which we will use for the same purpose.\n\n**4. Discover market needs:**\n\nBy accurately addressing brands’ pain points and needs, we anticipate more job opportunities for Decentraland creators. To accomplish this, we propose a brief product discovery and user research cycle, involving interviews with brands. This research will provide valuable insights into their preferences, challenges, and desired features, shaping our future development decisions and feature enhancements.\n\nCheck the financial report of our previous grant [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qMSZtMVFNOfcTCc_QGD6YNmmiHIOjh21bCIEwXVIK48).","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Contributor compensation","duration":3,"aboutThis":"Compensation for core team members for the 3-month period of this grant.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":33120},{"concept":"Operational costs","duration":3,"aboutThis":"Operations includes suscriptions to Calendly, Typeform, Sendgrid, Digital Ocean, and other tools.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1499},{"concept":"Marketing and lead generation","duration":3,"aboutThis":"We are not requesting a new budget for this effort, as we intend to use the surplus budget from our previous grant.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1}],"projectDuration":3,"vestingStartDate":"1st","categoryAssessment":{"impactMetrics":"**Our primary goal is to create job opportunities for Decentraland Creators.** To achieve our goal, these are the metrics we are looking to improve:\n\n- % of job opportunities posted for Decentraland creators\n- % engagement on our social media channels"}},"discourse_topic_id":19807,"scores_total":7503698.867720644,"votes":170,"manaVP":275531.11063651886,"landVP":338000,"namesVP":376700,"delegatedVP":6238270.757084124,"vesting_addresses":["0x774f958fc8928A9d6572f086FDEaE73fa583D251"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"07b77b7d-87ba-4234-bd33-544c53adfd0d","size":34620,"beneficiary":"0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d","category":"Platform","tier":"Higher Tier","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":1,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-11-10T15:25:00.600Z","pending_updates":1},{"id":"724e75e0-187c-11ee-93a7-ed9294f83f74","snapshot_id":"0x3f0c50268c1d2b5bda6fae62438039403fd0aa79817e88eee1515a62a0393962","user":"0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003","type":"grant","title":"Community NFT TCG Framework","start_at":"2023-07-02T02:02:00.782Z","finish_at":"2023-07-16T02:02:00.781Z","required_to_pass":3380000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":54500,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"thecryptotrader69@gmail.com","title":"Community NFT TCG Framework","choices":["yes","no","abstain"],"funding":54500,"members":[{"name":"TheCryptoTrader69","role":"Project Lead/Backend","about":"I've been programming and developing projects for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming.

This is a hobby (and profession) for millions of people across the globe. There are several extremely popular online TCGs (Hearthstone, Gwent, ESL), but they do not allow users to actively trade their cards or participate in an economy. By leveraging the immense popularity of this genre and utilising NFTs, we can offer a novel solution that empowers users to own and trade their cards, leading to substantial growth on the platform.\n\nThis is a smaller part of a long-term project (spanning 9 months) that will see both the creation of an open-source TCG framework and a playable TCG built using that framework. Not only will we be providing the community with a powerful tool to create their own TCGs and creating a new experience in Decentraland, we’ve also developed a sustainability plan that should allow the project to have continual development past the grant’s endpoint without additional community funding.\n\nThe first phase of this project will be the creation of the TCG framework. This framework will empower creators by providing all the utilities and tools required to create their own TCG in Decentraland. This includes easy ways to create cards, define card effects/mechanics, manage decks, and duelling other players.\n\nUsers will be able to maintain collections of cards on the blockchain via NFTs. All cards will be viewable in Decentraland, displaying the actual card and its associated model/effects. Users will also be able to modify and save their decks, allowing them to use the same decks across multiple scenes.\n\nUsers can also battle each other by engaging in duels. In these fights users will need to use a strategic mindset to overcome their opponent’s deck. These battles will follow the standard TCG formula: players expend energy to play cards during their, command units to attack, and attempt to claim victory by expending their rival’s hit points. Cards will appear in their 2D form when in the player’s hand, but when played they will expand into a 3D character (much like the popular TV show Yu-Gi-Oh). Card characters have animations/effects that are triggered by certain interactions (attack, death, ability, etc.).\n\nUpon the success of this grant, we are planning on requesting a future grant to fund the creation of a high-quality TCG built off this framework. After it has been fully developed, we will be hosting events (contests and tournaments) \n\nAs detailed before, all components of this grant and future grants for this project are going to be open-source, making *everything* produced free for the community to use and build upon. This also includes the cards and characters used in the TCG, as well as the management server used for storing player stats/data/game-play.\n\nThis grant only targets the first phase of the full project's plan: the creation of the TCG Framework (not the game, NFTs, or assets).

I came to Decentraland in the beginning of 2021, at that time I co-ran an independent outsource art studio for 6 years and had worked with traditional game studios, creative agencies and large clients in web2.\n\n**HISTORY:**\n\nMy first 3D professional job was at the age of 18 and it was for a digital marketing agency working for shopping television deadlines. After a hectic introduction to the 3D art world and working on product launches like Dre Beats back in 2009, I wanted to get back to my passions and went to university to study game art. During the 2nd year of studies I managed to secure a position as an art intern in a game studio working on launch titles for the Xbox One/PS4. \n\nThis isn't a long way of saying I'm old (lol), but I've grown with the technical requirements of an artist over the years and it has left me with a great repetoire of techniques that I've used since making content for Decentraland in order to get, what my business partner and myself deem, the best results with DCL shaders and technical specifications for wearables and for our clients.\n\nWe have had the pleasure of creating assets for the following brands/clients in web3 over the last 2 years;\n\n* D-Cave\n* Diesel\n* Ben Bridge\n* Kraken\n* Verse Digital\n* Deadmau5\n* Australian Open\n* Bulova\n* BBC\n* Adidas\n* The Vogu Collective\n* ANIMO Industries\n* JustHype UK\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\n We are proposing to create a tutorial series unlike others before, this won't be a 'beginner's tutorial series' however it will be accessible to wearable artists at all skill levels and information will be easily digestible for every step of the process.\n\nThere will be 3 main categories of tutorial videos;\n* **Concept to Completion** \n     * How to take a concept from a client, hired artist or even an AI generation and break it down technically to prepare for high resolution mesh production.\n     * How to prepare a high resolution mesh with specific rules to follow that will help the aesthetic finish of your final asset.\n     *  How to retopologise a low poly mesh (ingame ready) with both deformation of animation and texture finish (Unwrapping) in mind.\n     *  How to unwrap the low poly mesh with specific requirements in mind. \n     *  How to bake high poly to low poly with clean results and the correct texture map outputs required for further texture finish.\n     *  How to use the generated maps to create a texture base that is applicable for DCL shaders (Unlit, toon shader). \n     *  How to use everything generated before in the process so that it can be applied to other metaverse platforms (Interopability). \n     *  How to use the assets previously generated to render a clean thumbnail for various marketplaces.\n\n\n* **Source Asset to Completion**\n     * How to take a source asset from a client and make it DCL/Metaverse ready.\n     * This will repeat the steps above but with client branding fidelity taken into account.\n\n\n* **Special Case Techniques**\n     * A variety of videos showing off crazy and fun techniques (Fur, Deformation weighting fun etc...)\n\nThe purpose of this is to share the blueprint of our successful run and so that when a big brand comes knocking aspiring teams in this arena will have the confidence to follow through. It will also help independent community brands!\n\nExamples of style:\n\n[Golden Snubnose Chungus](https://tinyurl.com/dxw3y2x5)\n\n[Ben Bridge Mascot](https://tinyurl.com/bdcmnkmu)\n\n\n\n\n","paymentToken":"MANA","documentation":{"contentType":", Videos, Documentation Article, Other","totalPieces":3},"budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"3D Process Video/Audio Capture","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Malloy's 3D Secrets; \n- Every step recorded in the process of each series.\n- Recording audio narration to ensure clarity of each step.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":3500},{"concept":"2D Process Video/Audio Capture","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Catabasist's 2D Secrets:\n- After 3D process is complete, finishing touches to textures and techniques will be recorded. \n- Audio recording for process clarity.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":3500},{"concept":"Video Editing/Social Media Distribution","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Francis's output:\nOnce Malloy and Catabasist have provided all of the source video files and audio, it will be Francis's job to make it look snazzy, easy to digest and visually cohesive. \n\nFrancis will then take care of publishing and marketing of the course on socials.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":3000}],"projectDuration":1,"vestingStartDate":"1st","categoryAssessment":{"contentType":", Videos, Documentation Article, Other","totalPieces":3}},"discourse_topic_id":19799,"scores_total":10586797.736190185,"votes":166,"manaVP":96860.11562050776,"landVP":866000,"namesVP":365900,"delegatedVP":8966411.620569682,"vesting_addresses":["0xF7499bbDd0A37ac968cC5cE440F1994d4173145e"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"ac52b65d-d9aa-489c-86f2-e960cce6c202","size":10000,"beneficiary":"0xCC7BC60bFcC029ecC8357A9c80b4CC51aF67798E","category":"Documentation","tier":"Lower Tier","done_updates":0,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"late","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-09-01T00:01:05.919Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"7ffae250-193a-11ee-93a7-ed9294f83f74","snapshot_id":"0x6b525743281597735a0d20f74f92cd7ef10e21a8445b714922ff2b4c1635cebc","user":"0xedf458ce355c755e1973778b51b917066d4c0bad","type":"grant","title":"Meta Residence Tower (re-proposing to correct category)","start_at":"2023-07-03T00:42:00.101Z","finish_at":"2023-07-17T00:42:00.098Z","required_to_pass":5200000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":100000,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"digalgfund@pm.me","title":"Meta Residence Tower (re-proposing to correct category)","choices":["yes","no","abstain"],"funding":100000,"members":[{"name":"Anton Manakov","role":"TEAM LEAD, CO-FOUNDER","about":"Core developer of 8MetaBalls, 8MetaPawns, Meta Residence Tower.

However, many users do not and never will publish wearables because they do not have enough knowledge in 3D modeling.\n\nWe will encourage the creation of wearables by creating an add-ons repository to facilitate the creation of new original designs with add-ons that can be attached to each other, which will serve as a stimulus for those who do not know how to model in 3D.\n\nThis repository will consist of 800 add-ons for the upper body, lower body and feet categories. The add-ons will be assembled together automatically, so that the user will be able to easily create a wearable avoiding all the difficulties that a 3D modeler has in its initial stages, this will increase the incentive for users without knowledge in 3D modeling to create wearables.\n\nThis repository of 800 add-ons allows multiple possibilities for the near future if the community decides to complement it or continue working on it:\n\n- Add the remaining categories to create fully functional VRM avatars and skins.\n- Develop an app/graphical interface to further facilitate the construction of wearables.\n- Expand it to increase the possibilities of customization.\n\nProblem:\n\nCreators prefer other platforms over Decentraland.\n\nThe fact that the user base on Decentraland is not growing is because new users have no incentive to join or stay on the platform.\n\nThe bigger issue is that many of them would want to build, and would do so in Decentraland if it were easy, however building in the metaverse mostly requires knowledge of 3D modeling, something that is an insurmountable barrier to entry for those who have never used software like Blender, possibly more than 99% of potential users.\n\nThe proof that reflects this is that there are thousands of 2D image NFT projects that do not require advanced knowledge of any software, the success of this is because creating a 2D NFT is easy, while creating a wearable in Decentraland is difficult.\n\nSolution:\n\nFacilitating the creation of wearables with a system of add-ons that can be easily assembled together, we will be able to encourage new users to create in Decentraland.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Attract new creators.\n- Facilitate the creation of original wearables for users.\n- More income for the DAO through curator fees.\n\nTo know the details of this project you can read the following document: https://fastupload.io/fEoba6q45Wfn8Re/preview","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Repository cost","duration":3,"aboutThis":"Personnel or services necessary for the development of the add-ons.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":20950},{"concept":"Expenses","duration":3,"aboutThis":"Expenses of necessary supplies and services for 3 months.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":2550}],"projectDuration":3,"vestingStartDate":"1st","categoryAssessment":{"impactMetrics":"To assess the impact of the project upon completion, we will evaluate various metrics related to its objectives and expected results.

These artists will create new works in Decentraland for [MESH, the art fair for 3D, metaverse and VR creators](https://meshfair.com/) and for Metaverse Art Week 2023. Both will be held 19-23 July 2023.\n\nMESH and MVAW23 are being produced this year by [Vueltta](https://vueltta.com/), the arts collective behind DCL installations like The Labyrinth Effect (MVAW22) and Dear Vivienne (MVFW23). \n\nOur goals for both MESH and MVAW23 are:\n\n- To fully onboard 30+ new high-level creators to DCL.\n- To showcase the creative opportunities available to artists in DCL.\n- To provide exceptional, new art experiences to the DCL community. \n- To position DCL as an innovator within the contemporary art world.\n\n72 artists entered the [MESH Open Call](https://www.zealous.co/meshartfair/opportunity/MESH-3D-Metaverse-VR-Art-Fair/) for applications and 100 drafted submissions. Now 32 will be selected for MESH and will be onboarded to DCL for the MESH art fair in July. \n\nWhen we trialled the MESH concept with six 3D artists this May, it was clear that creators needed guidance in addition to the  [MESH Artist Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kMxhE15lj4ja4gQm9opDFlW7cHJ6b5dT/view) and DCL Documentation. Without support, MESH artists may fail to overcome technical difficulties while creating for DCL - and therefore disengage with the platform.\n\nIn our own requests for support as creators, we have been enormously impressed by the Community Building Decentraland (CBD) Discord, especially the live FAFO sessions, rapid answers to our questions, and Youtube ‘How To’ videos on topics such as Worlds. We therefore feel that this community can best provide guidance and content for MESH and MVAW artists this year. \n\nWe hope to gain DAO backing so that we can fund three active community members for 10 hours per week (each) in a Mentor role. All guidance content created will be opened to the community and to future onboarding artists.\n\nGuidance content created will include:\n- Twice weekly FAFO sessions (live technical support)\n- Youtube videos on recurring artist questions such as ‘How can I add URL links to my installation?’ ‘How can I stream video?’\n\nIn addition, the three MESH Mentors will commit the 10 hours each week to answer artists’ questions and address their concerns. They will answer these questions and compile both questions and answers into a public FAQ for creators.  \n\nThe MESH channel and educational content will be hosted by the CBD Discord to aid everyone in the community in building DCL. However CBD will not be receiving any monetary compensation from the grant. The funding will go to the three individual community members for their month-long support and content creation roles.\n\nWe see this as a great test case, in this ‘The Year of The Creator’, to see how artists can use DCL to create engaging new works. DCL’s current documentation does not fully support this creativity - artists need additional help and guidance. \n\nWe also believe that the opportunity to engage with DCL community members via CDB will help artists appreciate how DCL differs from other virtual worlds. Our goal is that each MESH artist will have positive associations with DCL and become advocates for the platform in the 3D community, as we (Vueltta) have become.","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"16 hours FAFO sesions @$15 / hr","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Live and recorded sessions on technical questions","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":240},{"concept":"4 x video production (27 hrs total) @$15/hr","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Creation of videos on key artist questions, publication on Youtube","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":345},{"concept":"20 hrs /week Discord support @$15/hr","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Discord technical support and compilation of a DCL FAQ for artists and creatives.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1350},{"concept":"6 hrs report on docs @$15/hr","duration":1,"aboutThis":"Feedback on how DCL documentation can be improved to support onboarding artists.

The motivation behind this is the theory that brands may want to create their own NFT stores in Decentraland if they don't have to code almost anything and they can accept $ICE as a payment method. \n\nWhy putting focus on $ICE? Because Decentral Games Poker players are earning this token 24/7 and they can spend it on DG or in... NFT stores! \n\nThe content of the video consists on:\n\na) Why an NFT project should start selling on Decentraland\nb) Where they should publish (DCL Worlds, land (bought/rented))\nc) How to create the store using the builder\nd) How to move the store from the builder to the SDK\ne) How to add DG Live\nf) How to configure the store using DG Live and accept $ICE, Coinbase/Binance payments and credit card\ng) How to deploy (both Genesis City and Worlds)\n\nThe video production process has been underway for the past two weeks, during which I have dedicated my time and efforts to create visually stunning animations using After Effects. The script has been carefully crafted to ensure it is easily understandable by individuals with varying levels of technical knowledge. Moreover, to streamline the store creation process, I have taken the initiative to make Mr. Dhingia Builds (https://unversed.org/wiki/misc/mrdhingia-dhingia-builds/) easily downloadable from my website (with his permission), accompanied by a promotional video to raise awareness (https://twitter.com/unversed_EN/status/1664278130075504643).\n\nI firmly believe that my previous work on Decentraland has demonstrated its value to the platform, and I am confident that this video will be no exception. To access my previous work, kindly visit https://youtube.com/TobikCC. You can see that some of those videos (like the VR one) are being actively watched and recommended by the developers.\n\nWhile I am committed to completing the video regardless, I kindly request financial support to compensate for the considerable time and effort invested in this project. The return on investment for this video is expected to be high, and such support would serve as both motivation for me to continue creating valuable content.

We believe this will be a good contribution to examples of complex scenes and will certainly be one of the largest contributions to open-source scenes. But at the same time we will maintain the in-world version. These projects cover significant numbers of features might be helpful for the community.","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Frontend Development","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This includes frontend for MRT & different versions of the Meta Residence Worlds","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":30000},{"concept":"Backend Development","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Server backend, DB, Video Server, CDN, Actions, CI/CD, Testing Environment.

That became reality in 2018 and by 2019 the park was filled with various hackathon-winners and mini-games.\n\nWonderMine quickly became one of the most popular Decentraland games, and has become something of a staple. WonderMine is one of the first places new players visit when they enter Decentraland for the first time, a feat we’re very proud of. WonderMine playership increased steadily over time. We currently support about 1,400 players per day (DAU).\n\nSince the WonderMine alpha first launched in June 2020:\n\n* Over **300,000 unique players** have played (mining at least one meteor)\n* Hit a peak DAU of **over 10K players** (December 2021) without performance issues\n* Nearly **20K wearables** (19,865) given to players who crafted them\n* Over **3,600 WonderZone Pickaxe NFTs** given out\n* Over **20 “2X Loot Drop” events** with 300 to 1000 players attending\n* Over **a dozen different collab events** with projects like DG, Vroomway, MetaParty and MetaKey\n\nWonderZone received a Tier 6 grant in January 2022 with a very ambitious roadmap. We planned to hire a new developer but that didn’t pan out, so the full roadmap was more than our small team could accomplish in 6 months. Even so that grant let some of us work full-time, and since we didn’t end up hiring another game dev the funds lasted us almost a full year, instead of 6 months. \n\nHere is what we achieved in 2022:\n\n* Developed a custom NFT smart contract (audited by Solidity Finance: https://solidity.finance/audits/WonderZone) \n* Released the WonderZone Games NFT collection (https://opensea.io/collection/wonderzonegames) \n    * Released 5 NFT pickaxes, with more on the way\n    * Auto-minting when players craft an NFT pickaxe\n    * Innovative contract supports per-item attributes and leveling-up\n* In-game highscores (level + meteors mined)\n* Level-locked crafting\n* Limited item crafting (one per player)\n* Updated UI\n    * Improved meteor loot pop-up\n    * Pickaxe switching functionality\n* Backend event manager (work in progress)\n    * Hub for WZ staff with data dashboards\n    * Easier and quicker to host events in WonderMine\n    * Faster support ticket processing\n* WonderZone Guild House building\n    * A central hub for the WonderZone Amusement park\n    * More buildings in development\n* Many, many, many new WonderZone wearables\n* Seasonal wearables, an organized way of releasing wearable collections\n    * Each season contains 10 new wearables every 2 months\n    * Offered Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs, another step towards self-sufficiency for WonderZone\n* Hired part-time back-end developer/Azure expert\n    * Refactored back-end/server infrastructure for performance and better internal testing\n    * Improved CoinCart process\n\nWe have learned a lot in 2022. We feel more confident in our abilities to deliver on our more realistic goals and milestones. These are features we believe will elevate the current singleplayer mining experience and help us attract new players to the WonderMine game and to Decentraland.\n\nOur goals for WonderMine were to create a game that’s fun to come back to every day and to become a social hub where people hang out in Decentraland, mining and chatting. We feel we’ve been successful with these goals. Our high player retention numbers put us in the top 75% of all games (not just metaverse games). Many of our top players have been playing WonderMine for over two years.","specification":"WonderMine is a social hub, but the gameplay is entirely single-player. Players only see the meteors that fall in their own instance of the scene. With the next roadmap we want to encourage multiplayer gameplay.\n\nThe first step is to enable shared, synchronized meteors, so everyone can see the same drop. This would make all active players rush over to a single location to get the loot first.\n\n## Shared Meteors\n\nWe want to add complexity to the current meteor system, with new categories and tiered meteors that require different levels to mine, including a few meteors that will require collaboration and multiple people to mine at the same time. These meteors will be full of juicy loot! Encouraging players to rush over to these new meteors adds a level of competition to the gameplay, and also requires teamwork to get the loot. \n\nPlayers will still see their own meteors fall at a similar rate. But sometimes a larger, special meteor will drop at the same location for everyone in the scene. The special meteor will require at least 10 players to mine it before it breaks open. Then all 10 players will receive a better-than-normal loot drop for their cooperative mining help.\n\nShared meteors add a new level of player cooperation to the game, which should encourage more interaction and socializing among players. It also adds a competitive element, since you have to be one of the first 10 players to get there.\n\nAfter we deliver the first tier of shared meteors, we have ideas for expanding to other specialty meteor tiers with different in-game mechanics to make WonderMine even more fun.\n\n## The Town Square\n\nWe have begun building a new town square which is going to be a central hub in WonderZone. The square is where new players will spawn and get introduced to WonderZone and all of our games. A place for players to socialize, trade, craft and quest.\n\nWe also want to create a venue with a big screen and stage near WonderMine for hosting events in WonderZone Park. This lets us pursue enhanced collaborations with other Decentraland projects and outside musical artists who can help attract new players. Our strength is in retaining players once they engage with our game. If we can attract new players to an event we can keep many of them playing for a long time to come.\n\n![Town Hub](https://wonderzone.io/img/promo/town1.jpg)\n\n## Seasonal Wearables\n\nWe have reorganized our wearable releases to be seasonal. We create up to 10 wearables and release them at the same time in the crafting machine. Each season contains 1 Mythic, 3-6 Legendaries and 3-6 Epics. The total craftable supply is 3k-6k per season. This means there are always wearables available for players to grind for when mining. \n\nWe want to keep being a hub for new players to socialize and craft their first NFTs for free. Bi-monthly seasonal wearable releases will ensure there are always new wearables for our players.\n \nWe recently introduced Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs for players who want to collect all of the wearables in a season. The Airdrop Passes for Season 1 cost 0.3 ETH each and sold out in about 30 minutes. Airdrop pass holders get all the wearables in a seasonal collection. We only sell 10 passes per season and it's the only way to get the seasonal mythic wearable.\n\nNearly all of our wearables can be crafted for free. Airdrop pass revenues are a small fraction of the cost to create the wearables, but it’s a step in the right direction of becoming a sustainable business."},"discourse_topic_id":17196,"scores_total":8957227.950315634,"votes":131,"manaVP":257083.0166962862,"landVP":834000,"namesVP":251400,"delegatedVP":7562612.9336193465,"vesting_addresses":["0xE40134701d6CA74AdDaFde34Ed9F7826AE568877"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"4c207e13-97c4-457e-b94d-e7c52b0f56aa","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":5,"late_updates":3,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-08-31T20:57:09.361Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"57496610-f545-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93","snapshot_id":"0x7b8cfbd8751a678a5b7449f9bc0094fad1a7638c297085d76d1acb1d81cfdd46","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"grant","title":"Decentraland DAO Facilitation Squad Grant Proposal [RENEWAL]","start_at":"2023-05-18T06:29:00.433Z","finish_at":"2023-06-01T06:29:00.432Z","required_to_pass":5140000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":98500,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"matimio@decentraland.org","title":"Decentraland DAO Facilitation Squad Grant Proposal [RENEWAL]","choices":["yes","no","abstain"],"funding":98500,"members":[{"name":"Matimio","role":"Team Manager ","about":"Matimio is a socio-technical engineer and the current DAO Facilitation Team Lead.

The team was able to understand their needs, identified in the last 6 month period 15 blockers and 55 requests (2 being solved by the team) and provided solutions to them. \nWe wrote the [grant's FAQs](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/grants-faq/) to the DAO documentation, added [security recommendations](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/security-recommendations/), we contributed to [17 AskMeAnything sessions](https://www.notion.so/decentraland/Decentraland-Foundation-Technical-AMA-230fcf1ca1ec4d49922744fe91e6995d) to connect the community with the Decentraland Foundation since Oct 2022. More recently, in March 2023 we have launched the **Testing Tuesday Initiative**, to give the grantees a space to demo their projects and get feedback from the community. So far we have hosted 11 sessions, and we’ve given POAPs to the community as a way to acknowledge their valuable contributions. We would like to continue **updating the documentation** and fostering spaces of collaboration between the Decentraland DAO and Decentraland Foundation, and provide support to the grantees in these or other initiatives that might arise based on their needs. \n\nAnother frequent request from our grantees has been **promotion**. We hired a copywriter (Luis Mienville) who so far had written [13 articles](https://decentraland.org/blog/author/decentraland-dao) in the Decentraland Blog about the amazing work our grantees are doing. We also encouraged grantees to show their progress in our **bi-weekly Townhalls**. Since September, we have an average of 3 grantees showing their progress in each Town Hall, who create videos and socialize with the community their advancements. We would like to continue nurturing these spaces of promotion, which are crucial to showcase their work.\n\nTo take care of the community treasury, we have recommended to the DAO committee to revoke grants that were delayed, not delivering their grant projects, or unable to finish due to technical blockers, until they can deliver their commitment with the DAO. In our last grant, **we had recovered** $565.842, and since then, 3 grant vesting contracts were resumed as they resolved their blockers, recovering from legacy revoked grants $181.619, and $75.000 from the renewed grants program adding a total of  **$256.619 to the DAO treasury** during this first year. We are creating a **Revocation Committee** to distribute this responsibility with selected members of the community. \n\nLast but not least, we have collaborated with the DAO Facilitation Squad and the DAO Governance Squad to provide them with continuous feedback and partner with them to generate synergy among our efforts to build transparency in the community via promotion and the governance dApp respectively. We’ve also collaborated providing insights to the DAO Committee to restructure the grants program. \n\nWe’d love to continue improve our grants program not only with the grantees, but with the broader Decentraland systems, and applying ongoing changes to better serve Decentraland’s sustainable growth.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15YQ3alNtXDXxehMRvgS5_ZOzMl_RgiMsGQ8IwOOJSmI/edit#gid=1600802421) you can see our financial report (jan22-apr23)","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Team Compensation","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This item includes the compensation for the entire team over the 6 month- period of the grant.

For more than a year, we have been committed to publicizing and expanding the platform in the country. During this period, our team and projects were financed exclusively with funds from the Founder's personal budget, without ever resorting to any funds from the DAO.\nSince the beginning, our main objective has been to educate and generate opportunities for all. We seek to attract new users, brands, and creators to Web3 to foster the growth and expansion of the platform. We support and launch new community talent, offering resources and guidance to help them achieve their creative goals. In addition, we encourage training for new creators, SDKs, and modelers, creating help groups where more experienced individuals offer support and guidance to beginners, sharing their knowledge and skills to help others grow and develop.\n\nAs the community grows and evolves, new talent is discovered and supported in their creative journeys. Through carefully planned actions and opportunities, the community is turning dreams into reality and cultivating a vibrant culture of creativity and innovation. Because we believe that everyone has unique skills and talents that deserve to be valued and supported, we work to promote actions that generate personalized opportunities for each individual, according to their skills and interests.\nDuring this period, the team's salary and the community's projects were financed solely by the Founder's personal budget. Some initiatives were taken, such as the purchase of land that today houses the headquarters of DCL Brazil, whose coordinates are (-107, -94). In addition, a community T-shirt was published, with free distribution to all members and interested parties. Twelve wearables were also created in collaboration with other members of the platform.

We provide rich experiences from multiple mini-games to the music stages, and we insert advertising in those experiences to make sure that the brands get exposure. You will see various forms of brand advertisements here, some are logos, some direct players to their Twitter or Discord, and some are 3d models of Brands' products. And in return, brands will provide attractive but limited wearables or NFTs as rewards, and players need to collect enough materials in games to claim the rewards, in this process, they will also notice Brands' advertisements which is how we bring awareness to brands.\n\n**Requested budget cut down?**\n\n From 60k to 55k\n\n**What brands have we already onboarded to Decentraland?

As a cash-flow generative and fundamentally Decentraland-backed asset, the DEX would provide a solid DeFi foundation for the ecosystem, and will benefit $MANA holders sustainably into the future. \n\nWith the Decentraland community containing many Web3 users and investors, the utility of an Decentraland DEX will generate significant value for existing holders, incentivize new Decentraland holders to join, bring liquidity providers into the $MANA ecosystem, and will create more demand for $MANA. Additionally, the fees derived from the DEX will serve to increase the DAO treasury value as a whole through DEX revenue.\nThe core of this proposal is centered around our motivation to build for the community, and embrace Web3 values through the implementation of technically sound, user-friendly, DeFi infrastructure.\n\nThe goal of the Decentraland DEX is to create a self-sustaining, cash-flow generative addition of digital infrastructure to the Decentraland ecosystem. Major swaps like Metamask, Uniswap, Sushi, and GMX offer trading fees as high as .875%.\n\nDecentraland DEX will provide: key trading pairs to allow our community to trade with a single DEX UI, competitive/lowest trading fees, charting, integration with other DAO infrastructure, top-of-the-line design and development, and more.\n\n$MANA generates over $100m per day in trading volume on average. If the Decentraland DEX is able to capture just 1% of this volume, the Decentraland treasury could grow by $720,000 over one year. Our proposal represents less than 10% of this cost.\n\n$MANA holders are valuable community members and the target market for DeFi products. Decentraland DEX offers $MANA holders a commercial incentive to support $MANA-backed infrastructure directly benefiting them and the DAO. DEX growth creates a flywheel of incentive for $MANA holders, driving further adoption.\n\nKey value to highlight:\nDEX will attract $MANA liquidity\nDAO establishes core DeFi infrastructure\nRevenue to be directed to Decentraland DAO to increase treasury holdings\nBrings DeFi users into Decentraland\n\nSpecifications |\nSolidity.io 2 will design, develop, and deploy a decentralized exchange for the Decentraland DEX.

High-quality documentation (like Mozilla's MDN) goes beyond technical specification and actually helps in writing solid code that works reliably and avoids common pitfalls. It’s alive, up-to-date with recent developments, aligned with current practice and responsive to feedback from readers.\n\nThis documentation must:\n- Provide a high-level overview of the protocol and all its components\n- Maintain an up-to-date specification of the most important APIs and components\n- Guide implementers towards good architectural decisions and away from pitfalls\n- Address common misunderstandings that tend to arise during development\n- Help readers navigate transitions from deprecated methods to newer variants\n- Welcome feedback from readers so they can point out problems and offer suggestions\n\n### Implementing Alternative Explorers\n\nThe World Explorer is the principal client of the Decentraland protocol, by virtue of using the entire set of features and introducing requirements that drive the development of the underlying software.\n\nWe’ll build three new implementations that rely on different frameworks and utilities, and can tackle these problems from a fresh start taking new approaches while armed with the accumulated lessons and discoveries of the Foundation.\n\n[Click here to read about the rationale and criteria used for each implementation](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Criterions-for-Engine-Selection-e55f8ea382f94ff0943bce383b7c7816), a [comparison of engines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15NOnGhBiVaZk4gTeW-Gmd7cWUdmf1_6PeUUPVTM5WtY/edit#gid=0) and how well do they fit with each criteria, and [join the discussion about the Protocol Squad](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-a-protocol-squad-for-the-dao/17000) on the forum.\n\nThe protocol documentation will be tested and refined as these efforts progress.\n\nThe three implementations have different goals:\n\n1. **Short-term, production-ready** (Unity): aiming to become the most popular among players, this implementation would prioritize enhanced performance, distribution on game and app stores, broad reach for developers, and attention to legal licensing in today's market.\n\n2. **Educational** (BabylonJS): new developers joining the Decentraland community can greatly benefit from an implementation that prioritizes readability and organization, easy addition of new features, widely known programming languages and simple tooling. This implementation is meant for humans to read, learn and discuss improvements to the protocol.\n\n3. **Moonshot** (Bevy): an idealistic and forward-looking implementation, based on technologies that are currently immature but hold great promise for the future. This project would prioritize solid fundamentals, extensibility, and the use of modern open-source frameworks.","specification":"The Protocol Squad is a new DAO group focused on the technical protocols underlying the Decentraland experiences and products.\n\n### Tools\n* We will join the other DAO squads and use their Notion to coordinate our work.\n* We will publish materials we create on GitHub and GitLab, under the Decentraland Foundation's organization (if we get their approval) and mirror to our own organization (https://github.com/decentraland-protocol and https://gitlab.com/decentraland-protocol).\n* We'll use the Forum and Discord to communicate updates on our progress.\n\n### Current progress\nWe've already been working on this, funded out of our own pockets.

Our project aims to bring back this experience by integrating Decentraland with leading e-commerce platforms. Brands will be able to connect their online stores to their Decentraland scenes, allowing users to browse products, add items to their carts, and complete purchases within the metaverse. This not only benefits users but also provides brands with a new revenue stream and an opportunity to engage customers in a unique, immersive environment.\n\nIn order to develop the e-commerce integration with Decentraland, we will begin by exporting the brand's product catalog, which contains essential information such as price, color, variations, and availability. To create a visually appealing shopping experience within the metaverse, we will dynamically remove the background of each product image.\n\nThe  web dashboard will enable brands to easily manage their virtual stores. They can select products from their catalog to offer for sale and decide where to place them within their Decentraland scene.  We will have a set of 3D modules in which the products will be displayed nicely and in which the users will be able to interact as if they were inside the store for real.\n\nTo make shopping as smooth as possible, we will develop a comprehensive module for creating an unique account which would work with any ecommerce that integrates this module, adding items to a user's cart and checking out directly within the metaverse. This module will handle all aspects of the shopping process, from browsing products to confirming the order.\n\nFurthermore, we will create a set of API methods to seamlessly integrate with the brand's existing e-commerce platform. These API methods will enable the automatic creation of orders on the brand's e-commerce system and facilitate the payment process for users. This integration ensures that brands can efficiently manage their virtual and physical store sales while providing users with a secure and convenient shopping experience in Decentraland.\n\n\nThese are a couple of reasons of why we believe this would really benefit decentraland:\n\nShopping User Experience: Integrating e-commerce within Decentraland will give users a reason to spend more time in the metaverse. Users can explore virtual stores and shop with friends from around the world.\n\nAttracting Brands and Driving Monetization: Decentraland can attract more brands looking to establish a presence in the metaverse. This, in turn, creates new revenue streams for Decentraland, as well as for the brands themselves, through virtual store sales and potential advertising opportunities.\n\nLeverage on metaverse E-commerce:  E-commerce is predicted to become one of the main sources of revenue in the metaverse by 2030, offering an integrated e-commerce solution can help solidify this business vertical. \nhttps://i.postimg.cc/gkckvyHM/4607fe1b-0eb7-4f01-bfe9-ad7074630183.jpg\n\nIn other words, this product can generate experiences inside the metaverse which are not dependant on time, users can join at any time and shop around. At the same time, it allows brands to develop content inside decentraland and find a way to actually monetize them to keep on building and not just doing one marketing activation and leave an empty scene.","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Project Planning and Management","duration":1,"aboutThis":" a.

We have taken the time to listen to the community's feedback and have worked hard to refine our 2D model while also developing the 3D version of the game.\n\nWe recently imported our game into WebGL, The community wanted the game to be directly accessible on DCL without a frame. As a result, we have made adjustments to our approach and have imported WebGL on a separate page but are working on a 3D game mode in DCL aswell.\n\nWe have also implemented a data storage system using PlayFab that enables players to make progress in either the 2D or 3D game, and it will carry over to the other platform. We believe that this feature will be a significant asset to the game and add value to the player experience.\n\nWe have a webpage for our proposal active for this proposal and will share a document with fundamentals.\n\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant-proposal \n\n**Contributing to Decentraland's Growth:**\nAdditionally, we aim to contribute to the growth and success of the Decentraland platform. Our game will bring increased engagement and activity to the platform, and our data storage and crossover system will set a new standard for games on the platform.\n\n**Experienced Team:**\nOur team has the necessary skills and experience to make Duel Arena a success, and we are committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our project deserves funding because of its unique features, potential benefits, and alignment with the vision and mission of the Decentraland platform.\n\n**Progress Made:**\nWhile we have made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena for the Decentraland platform, it's important to note that the 3D game is not yet finished. However, we have created a 2D game that is currently live and playable on itch.io. We have designed the 2D game to serve as a demo for the 3D game and showcase some of the features and content that we plan to include.\n\n**Battleground Map:**\nDespite the 3D game being a work in progress, we have made significant strides in its development, as outlined in the previous section. Our team is confident in our ability to complete the development of Duel Arena and deliver a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We have also developed a unique battleground map that is set on a floating platform above the 3D game map.\n\n**Functional Buttons and Wearables:**\nFurthermore, we have created several UI buttons such as Play 2D, Home, and Play Now. We have also developed functional buttons for gathering resources, including wood, fire, dandelions, and water. Winning battles will give players game currency that can be used to purchase wearable NFTs that give bonuses in-game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOur team has made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena and is committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our game has the potential to contribute to the growth and success of the platform, and we are excited to continue our work on this project.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0i6oZgi","paymentToken":"DAI","budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"Game Development","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This will cover the cost of hiring a skilled game developer who will be responsible for coding the game mechanics, designing and implementing the UI/UX, and testing and refining the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":26000},{"concept":"Graphic Designer ","duration":6,"aboutThis":"Our game designer will work on to create the 3D game assets, the 2D game assets, and all visual elements of the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":18500},{"concept":"Sound Designer","duration":2,"aboutThis":"We will hire a sound designer to create and implement sound effects and background music for the game.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":1000},{"concept":"Marketing and Advertising","duration":6,"aboutThis":"This will cover the cost of marketing and advertising campaigns to raise awareness and generate interest in Duel Arena.

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n[Demo](https://dark-dungeons.herokuapp.com)\n\n[Proposal Demo](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-de7fa02-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland-demo/15603)\n\n[Discord Demo](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1027268770923827320)\n\n[CEN Discord](https://discord.gg/U3w9CZRg)\n\nWe believe the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be its copy. We plan to fill the game with popular memes and other humorous content. There will also be cameos with famous pop culture characters. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of their experience.\n\n### Scope ###\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of September 2023. Our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have, by the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all Decentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics ###\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to Decentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n● A session in D&D lasts, on average, 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 15-20 minutes.\n\n● An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host). Players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n\n### How we see the final result: ###\n\n1. 1-4 players in total in one session.\n2. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\nin the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3. The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\nreceive a task from a non-player character in the story. (We expect that the comicality of some situations and the integration of memes and pop culture characters will have a positive impact on marketing.)\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager-werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 4 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.","paymentToken":"DAI","inWorldContent":{"totalUsers":8,"totalPieces":1,"engagementMeasurement":"The number of users who visited the LAND, mentions in social networks, etc."},"budgetBreakdown":[{"concept":"SDK Dev","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":12500},{"concept":"3D Artists","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":10000},{"concept":"Game Designer","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":7500},{"concept":"2D Artist","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":4000},{"concept":"Game Master","duration":4,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":3500},{"concept":"Sound Designer","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Team Salaries","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":2500},{"concept":"Marketing","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Bloggers, social networks and others.","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":4000},{"concept":"Servers and infrastructure","duration":8,"aboutThis":"Software","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":3000},{"concept":"Land Rental for 6 months","duration":8,"aboutThis":"1x1 LAND","relevantLink":"","estimatedBudget":500}],"projectDuration":8,"vestingStartDate":"15th","categoryAssessment":{"totalUsers":8,"totalPieces":1,"engagementMeasurement":"The number of users who visited the LAND, mentions in social networks, etc."}},"discourse_topic_id":18595,"scores_total":10735310.462865405,"votes":238,"manaVP":14895.185489291502,"landVP":160000,"namesVP":351500,"delegatedVP":10115667.277376113,"vesting_addresses":["0x7BaC399AA10adb3aB9E44Dc44f1CC2A93F0C0f92"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"992ebe6d-037c-4f0c-af72-04812f8eb598","size":47500,"beneficiary":"0x2e09A10eaAcE1Ef3a66FbF6F1F782C8c0cb8c942","category":"In-World Content","tier":"Higher Tier","done_updates":7,"late_updates":2,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2024-02-19T23:26:47.810Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"8a26c5c0-b95c-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986","snapshot_id":"0x2f512a95b27bc18111eab7a678d397c1b256752205b10e7155ec98efc048fa3d","user":"0xc82fd31500576f394b59be3b10c154b584ea6004","type":"grant","title":"ShelleyVan x TRU Band Room","start_at":"2023-03-03T00:44:00.428Z","finish_at":"2023-03-17T00:44:00.427Z","required_to_pass":6000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":120000,"tier":"Higher Tier","email":"rockwithtrus@gmail.com","title":"ShelleyVan x TRU Band Room","choices":["yes","no"],"funding":120000,"roadmap":"**Oct 31, 2021 - Feb 28, 2023:** hosted over 500 live events, onboarded over 125 musicians, which resulted in nearly 2000 unique event attendees (this number only reflects May 1, 2022-Feb 2023, we do not have an accurate count of users prior to that date)\n\n**March 2023 - March 2024:** 300+ live events, onboard an additional 50+ musicians new to DCL, and provide an immersive introduction to 10+ high-value web2 influencers\n\n**We will provide monthly updates here to include:**\n\nNumber of events hosted at TRU\n\nLinks to online content created (blog articles, YouTube videos)\n\nLinks to any newly onboarded artists, influencers, users","abstract":"The TRU Band Room (TRU), under the management of Shelley VanWitzenburg (ShelleyVan), is the premier music venue in Decentraland (DCL) for new and emerging independent artists.

During her time managing TRU, many highly successful musicians and DJs in DCL have made their metaverse debut here, including Bufalo, Mr.Swe, DJ T-Rax, Jack Frost, Pan’s DJ, Coconut Sunday, The Musical Doc, and Ash Orphan. During the last year, she has maintained a consistent schedule of live performances, averaging five to ten shows per week, and has developed a comprehensive DCL onboarding experience.\n\nIn addition to managing the live performances, ShelleyVan spends a considerable amount of time onboarding artists and providing tech support, including soundchecks and web3/NFT consultation. With additional funding, a structure will be developed which allows ShelleyVan to expand the onboarding experience to larger communities. To achieve this goal, multimedia resources will be developed, including video courses, one-page guides, social media content, and SEO blog articles targeting specific web3/metaverse keywords to capture new audiences.\n\nAs co-founder of Songbird Collective, a digital marketing agency, ShelleyVan has developed partnerships and relationships with a large number of web2 social media influencers, who have yet to experience web3 or the metaverse. The expansion of onboarding will include targeting those influencers with established, engaged audiences to accelerate DCL user growth and retention objectives.\n\nAlso, building on existing Decentraland partnerships, ShelleyVan/TRU will expand co-marketing and promotional opportunities with other DCL venues and projects. During the last year, TRU has partnered with casa Roustan, Dollhouse, Cromuland/YouMack, Sugar Club, and MetaParty to amplify promotional content for events. This co-marketing has helped achieve increased attendance and user retention by promoting a multi-venue schedule of events. An expansion of TRU operations will increase the opportunity to plan and execute larger and more frequent multi-venue events–aligning with strategic objectives to increase DCL user growth.\n\n**Examples of Community Experiences:**\n\n**DCLMVMF22:**\nThe TRU Stage at Decentraland Metaverse Music Festival ran 31 shows in 4 days, hosting independent musicians from all over the world\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMtK8wgr6Pk\n\n**Connecting the [POI] Stars:**\nCommunity line-up between casa Roustan and TRU Band Room to connect the dots on the map\n\nhttps://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1503103595578859528\n\nShelleyVan to attend IRL Events - \n\nNFT LA - confirmed \n\nNFT NYC - TBD\n\n**The TRU SHOAP:**\n\nThe TRU proprietary attendance token system has already airdropped tokens to nearly 2,000 Decentraland users since May 1st 2022. \n\nNovember 2, 2022 - Introduced AI-Generated SHOAP Art\n\nIn collaboration with the performing artist, AI-generated artwork is used for the token, creating a truly unique memento for attendees.","paymentToken":"DAI","specification":"In addition to maintaining an aggressive calendar of events, TRU Band Room will expand their onboarding experience to music, NFT, and web2 communities. Currently, Band Room activities require nearly 60 hours of work per week. The expanded TRU operation, under the management of ShelleyVan/Songbird Collective, will utilize the following to achieve an increase in event attendance and improve user retention:\n\nBuild SEO and content strategy to establish pillar articles focusing on DCL–-all supporting content will link back to these pillar articles. Examples of pillar topics include technical requirements, web3 safety, and comprehensive DCL user guide.\n\nLIVE DCL onboarding boot camps held at least monthly, targeting already established communities and individual new users.\n\n-Continue to support independent musicians’ success in DCL, offering a free stage for them to market their work and find their footing with superior quality sound/video capabilities in DCL\n\n-Continue running 6+ live events per week (recent attendance on parcel ranges between 30-100 visitors)\n\n-Continue using and improving proprietary attendance token airdrop system to draw new users (free NFT airdropped to all who attend shows in DCL) https://opensea.io/collection/tru-shoap\n\n-Quarterly festival-style events (multi-venue when possible)\n\n**To address the elephant in the room:** Yes, The Rocking Uniquehorns is an NFT project. So far, all the revenue that was generated was either used to directly support independent artists or to fund the building, land rental, marketing & operational costs associated with the TRU Band Room in Decentraland.\n\nIt was never a typical NFT project with the intention of selling out fast and catering to the trading part of the web3 user base. It was designed as a slow mint from the very beginning, so that it allows people to see and experience what we’re about and have a way of showing their support for our mission of bringing music to the metaverse, by minting a TRU. We absolutely love the community we’re building this way and this will be the way we continue to run that part of the project.\n\nThat being said, if for whatever reason the minting pace picks up (wen bull? ;) ) and we happen to mint out the collection, we’re more than happy to pay it forward or repay this grant.\n\nTo help cover some of the costs of the last year+ of event hosting, server fees, outsourced building, etc. TRU is requesting a retroactive amount of $60,000 and an additional $60,000 for the next year.\n\n**See full budget breakdown here:**\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ProxmIuVOrQY8hkd7JuwinqJLDtP_Hdx/view?usp=share_link","inWorldContent":{"totalUsers":15000,"totalPieces":300,"engagementMeasurement":"**We collect the following stats per live event:** \n\nNumber of user visits to parcel–including guest accounts\n\nNumber of users who stayed on-parcel long enough to trigger SHOAP airdrop\n\n*15000 is based on an average number of attendees multiplied by average number of shows per month.

To accomplish this, we will work on three key areas of the business growth of Decentraland creators: \n\n**Streamlining Job Opportunities for Decentraland Creators**\n\nWe are working on a feature through which brands can post job openings for Decentraland creators. Any brand can create a job indicating the type of project they want to develop (along with a description, skills needed, budget and timeline), and all Decentraland Studios will be able to apply. We expect this feature to remove friction for brands to hire Decentraland creators. The user flow for creating a job and applying to one will be similar to how [Dribbble implemented it](https://dribbble.com/freelance-jobs). \n\n**Lead generation**\n\nCreate performance marketing campaigns in web2 platforms such as Linkedin, Twitter, Google, and Instagram targeted to brand owners and marketers interested in building a presence in the Metaverse. The ads campaign will direct users to our landing page collecting their emails in exchange for an onboarding guide. After that point, the leads will be followed up by emails introducing interesting content and calling them to start a new project (see point above).\n\n**Maintenance and improvement**\n\nWe will continue onboarding and verifying studios to our platform while listening to our community and taking their feedback. Right now, we are looking to: \n\n- Add search, filtering and sorting features to projects, studios and resources\n- Keep improving the resource section, adding case studies and more scenes\n- Keep updating the “Guide Into The Metaverse” and translating it to other languages\n- Featuring projects to highlight skills and talent\n- Having a dedicated section for Decentraland Studios in decentraland.org\n\nWe are looking to grow the following metrics:\n\n- Visitors to our website\n- Brands connecting with studios through our platform","paymentToken":"DAI","specification":"Salaries:\n* $12,200 USD per month or a total of $48,800 USD\n* Total Hours: ~360 monthly hours or ~90 weekly hours.\n\nMarketing Budget:\n* $200 USD per day, $6,000 USD per month or a total of $24,000 USD.\n* Paid marketing campaigns at Instagram, Linkedin, Google, Twitter targeted to brand owners.\n\nOperations:\n* $500 USD per month or a total of $2,000 USD\n* Subscriptions to Calendly, Typeform, Sendgrid, Digital Ocean, Plausible, Figma.","projectDuration":4,"vestingStartDate":"1st"},"discourse_topic_id":18272,"scores_total":8470001.798172034,"votes":166,"manaVP":4491806.656525825,"landVP":1832000,"namesVP":247200,"delegatedVP":1877282.1416462124,"vesting_addresses":["0x26e9108544c6aEDC99335699Cdbed67908A97e4C"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"b38012a3-9c68-4a83-adb3-a1eeeef7bc64","size":74800,"beneficiary":"0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d","category":"Platform","tier":"Higher Tier","done_updates":4,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":1,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-08-10T13:46:00.349Z","pending_updates":1},{"id":"21db21b0-bc53-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be","snapshot_id":"0x0a581f2f7ea548cc89c88b4fee8c592ef1612532085d898eb8f1a82d20e02c46","user":"0xe400a85a6169bd8be439bb0dc9eac81f19f26843","type":"grant","title":"Creation of DAO-Owned Catalyst Archival Node for Decentraland Core","start_at":"2023-03-06T19:14:00.467Z","finish_at":"2023-03-20T19:14:00.466Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":19800,"tier":"Lower Tier","email":"howie@atlascorp.io","title":"Creation of DAO-Owned Catalyst Archival Node for Decentraland Core","choices":["yes","no"],"funding":19800,"roadmap":"Currently the footprint of a node is about 2.25 TB which is expected to grow over time.

These API queries will include information that has been asked of the Atlas CORP team but to date are not possible to answer without a historical catalyst node. These queries may include the ability to answer the following questions:\n\n•\tWhen did a user first sign up for Decentraland?\n\n•\tWhat is a user’s “user number”, from the ranked order all users signed up for Decentraland?\n\n•\tWhat parcels did a scene cover in the past?\n\n•\tWhat parcels did a scene cover over time?\n\nQuery documentation (e.g. Redoc) will be published and made available for users looking to operate or integrate with the API.","abstract":"We believe there is a need to provide a DAO-owned Decentraland catalyst node for the community to use for applications.

The node network saves information on scene deployments, user profiles, and other Decentraland content that is not directly on chain but requires storage. Any application that wants to use this data – say to display the profile pictures of the user on an app, or to understand what parcels are associated with a scene – would use the APIs available on the catalyst nodes. If the application ecosystem around Decentraland begins to scale, this may cause an undue burden or strain on the node network as this load is above and beyond what is required to support users in game.\n\nSimilar to the DAO Data Aggregation initiative we undertook at the end of last year, we believe there is a need to stand up a dedicated catalyst node which can be used by the community for applications and application development.

This is already starting to gain popularity in the industry (emerging projects: https://www.educative.io/blog/top-uses-gpt-3-deep-learning)\n\nDecentraland can benefit a lot from leveraging these OpenAI tools. Builders will be able to save thousands of hours spent on manually creating scenes, assets, avatars, etc.   \n\nHere are some basic use cases we’re planning to integrate with our tool:\n\n**Generating Custom Entities, Components, Actions**\n\n- Run primary queries like “*create a scene with a lot of trees*” and secondary queries like “*add a moving bird everytime a tree is clicked*”\n- Actionable scenes like “*create a drunk zombie*”, “*add unicorns next to the zombie*”, “*a jumping shark*”, “*a jumping shark with a drunk zombie*”, etc.\n- Event based assets like “*party rooms*”, “*sports avenue*”, “*cube jumper*”, etc.\n\nFor the scenes, there will be a split pane, with an editor, and a previewer - code generated through the prompt will be visible on the editor, and the user will be able to see its preview on the previewer, manipulate it, provide feedback, and even publish it to their land by connecting their wallet on DCLBuilderAI. We’ll be using SDK7 for enhanced performance/usability for our project.\n\nWe’ll create a separate pipeline to ingest all the available training data from decentraland scenes repo, SDK, and other public sources, and feed it into the codex da vinci model, fine-tuning for it to work with DCL (and generate valid output) will happen through OpenAI as well. On top of this, by giving the users the option to provide feedback on the accuracy of the results, we’ll be able to optimize feedback loops, decrease statistical errors like type-IIs, and just deliver better content. The model, training, fine-tuning, and api will be part of codex and will come from OpenAI whereas Tensorflow will be used for the data ingestion pipeline process.\n\nNote that this tool will not be assisting with minting and listing assets on the DCL marketplace but will be providing an editor and preview option for working with assets. Besides, the results are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and will hopefully improve over time with the help of the feedback loop.","specification":"The project will require working with a number of key services such as OpenAI, Tensorflow, MetaMask, DCL SDK7, and other web development frameworks/tools.

Sugar Club is welcoming existing DJs from our web3 network  ( Bufalo , Greencross, Gucci Toe,  Alien DJ , Panther Modern, Mighty33, Superflat , AmbieNFT , Mumbai Science , GraffitKings, EzzyLand , Eclectic Method , DJ Laroc, DJ LethalSkillz, Bootsy Collins etc.) .\n \nI also want to explore onboarding other  DJs and electronic producers by leveraging some of my existing contacts internationally. I have contacts in Europe, notably France, Belgium, Austria, the UK , Mexico/ South America, as well as South Korea.\n \n### Game dev \n\n Last year updates have included a new video screen projection code from the SDK repository, upgrading the main stage, optimizing textures, colliders, creating a new UI system to interact with, cleaning up all the modules of the code so they are better organized for debugging, and finally overhauling the VIP gate code to include Polygon as well as Ethereum contracts (an essential part of using NFT ticket access on Polygon)\n \nI would love to have a proper budget for game development, to maintain and debug code when necessary but also to be able to hire on demand for specific features such as a gamified experience at the club .\n\n### Retroactive costs\n\nI would like to use this grant to fund early hardware such as my mocap suit for emote creation and the 2nd laptop i use to log into DCL","specification":"## Budget specification\n\n### Servers and streaming\n| **Servers and streaming** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Audio / video servers | 3000 |\n |**TOTAL**| **3000 USD**\n\n### Software\n| **Software** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Photoshop (graphic tool)| 180 |\n| Substance Painter texturing  (3d model texturing)| 212| \n| Blender 3D add-ons (3d modeling tool) | 300 |\n| Marvelous Designer (digital garment creation) | 280 |\n| Zrbush sculpting (3d modeling tool) | 390 |\n| DJ software | 99 |\n|VJ software | 99 |\n| Audio library (paid tracks and samples) During Dj sets| 1000 |\n|Graphic AI generation tools for visuals (graphic tool) | 300 |\n |**TOTAL**| **2860 USD**\n\n### more info on software costs\n\nMaking 3d content via blender is free, however professional paid tools are essential to help with workflow and quality of delivery.\n \nOne example is wearable production. The professional workflow of designing a wearable with very detailed realistic textures is as follow:\n \nCreate High Poly model > retopology to low poly model > bake high level details onto low poly > finish texturing on low poly > dcl builder testing\n \nThis workflow requires multiple paid software such as:\n \n>    Zbrush and Marvelous Designer for high resolution garments creation\n\n>   Retopology add-ons for creating the low poly model\n\n>    Substance Painter for texturing the garments and baking the details  \n \n \nThese Tools are industry standards in 3d creation and are essential for digital fashion creation of high-quality garments. \n\nOther essential paid add-ons for blender include Motion capture retargeting tools for emote creation, Hard surface modeling tools, UV mapping tools etc...  \n \nAll those subscriptions combined become a workflow that helps content creation tremendously and are essential to operate on a professional level as a digital artist.\n\n\n\n### Hardware\n| **Hardware** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Separate Laptop for DCL events (retroactive) | 1000 |\n|Mocap suit for emote creation (retroactive)|   2000       |\n| Pro DJ mixer / controller / audio interface | 900| \n| Headset | 80 |\n |**TOTAL**| **3980 USD yearly**\n\n>We use a main desktop station for our broadcasting,  and a smaller laptop to tune into Decentraland during events.\n \n>We also need to upgrade to a DJ controller/mixer for live DJ sets and live streaming.

We plan to have a public Discord server for the scene setup, as well as to have it be monitored by familiar community members. We plan to have weekly live sessions with our builders behind the scenes and voice chats of our modeling and building progression. We as a group will regularly communicate our status through social channels like Twitter and Instagram, and are open to receiving input from the community at any point along the way. Progress and updates will be officially documented moving forward to display the history and growth of the Marketplace. This will allow for the community to follow along and stay in touch with the new developments on the build.

You examine its exterior and notice a gold-tinged seal with a coin-shaped sigil embossed into it. Suddenly, the seal springs open and grains of sand fly out in a flurry around you. Moments later, after you’ve regained your senses, you realize that you’re in a completely new area of the world – somewhere massive, surreal, sandy, and bustling with life.\n\n“Welcome, human, to the marketplace,” a peculiar voice calls from an alley behind you, “I see you received my letter. Come, this way...” they say as their wrinkly, bejeweled finger beckons you to follow.\n\n**Description**\n\nFull doc -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10gLDguQpjONSHXQZe6_aO9DopUoWXMC3e4Jp4xzYAi8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe marketplace at its core will address three common-sense problems that have yet to be implemented into the Decentraland experience: trying on and purchasing Marketplace items as a User, showcasing created items to sell in Storefronts as a Creator, and participating in the DAO as a Voter. The Decentraland Foundation is hard at work on many areas for the platform, so it’s time the community steps up to help build out this much-desired in-game functionality.\n\nThe DCL platform has been around since 2018, yet we still purchase in-game items (clothing, land, names, nfts) and vote for change through our browsers rather than inside the world of Decentraland. The marketplace aims to provide an improved experience to users by offering a free way to purchase and sell items in-game without ever having to leave the game world or pull up a second window.\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has put a lot of effort into creating such an amazing platform for us all to meet, create, and explore. However, they must also rely on the community for innovation given the scale of the world. Our proposal aims to take some burden off the Foundation by building out these in-game purchasing experiences while also building amazing immersive content for the entire community. Being transparent, yes, it is already possible to sell wearables on your land in Decentraland. However, doing so remains a technical feat for most that requires an advanced skill set as well as land to deploy to. Doing so also lacks cohesion across a broader Marketplace vision that the marketplace seeks to accomplish through its initial Phase I deliverables.\n\nIn addition to the core functionality of the marketplace, our proposal touches on two gamification points: content creation and user retention. Through quests, storylines, factions, level progression, secret unveilings, in-game rewards, event spaces, and additional core activations such as future minigame(s), the marketplace will provide Decentraland users with engaging content that continues to evolve in complexity over time.\n\nThe marketplace is proposed to be 20x20 parcels (400 total) in size, which is the same scale as Genesis Plaza — that’s 1,102,223 square feet, 25.3 acres, or just over 19 football fields. The proposed location of the marketplace will be one of the two existing duplicate Plazas within Decentraland. Having a duplicate plaza is a redundant use of 400 parcels and there is currently no dedicated team at the Foundation to support the ongoing development of Genesis Plaza or its periphery.\n\nThis proposal, along with our proven team of dedicated creators, plan to transform this duplicate plaza into the marketplace vision laid before you.","specification":"**Phase 1 Deliverables**\n\n**The Oasis Central Hub**\n\nThe Oasis Central Hub, currently dubbed simply the Hub or Oasis, will be the primary entrypoint for anyone teleporting to the marketplace and is located at the absolute center of the plaza. It will be the largest piece of open air architecture and will act as the center for all marketplace-related content. Think of main online areas from Ralph Breaks the Internet and Ready Player One, or perhaps even RuneScape’s Grand Exchange for reference:\n\nAside from being a social center, the Hub will provide multiple “Info Desks” where Users will be able to obtain area information, see new item releases, and virtually search for wearables to discover, try on, and purchase from the Marketplace. Another part of the Hub will be the “Quest Desk” which will be touched on later. There will also be open gathering spaces for players to hang out, socialize, discuss trades/quests/etc. Additional planned interactivity includes various NPCs, custom signage, possible ‘secret’ quests, and a live visual $MANA feed to name a few.\n\n**The Marketplace Fields & Storefronts**\n\nThe marketplace fields will be organized into 4 quadrants around the Oasis Hub that will be populated with virtual Storefronts for all Creators. At the time of initial launch, 2 of the fields will be publicly open with the other 2 fields reserved for future expansion. Storefronts will initially focus on displaying primary sale products, but we plan to support secondary sale displays at a later date.\n\nEach field is huge – think of a massive flea market that looks like Dune meets Star Wars, or the RPO Columbus Stacks meets a Middle Eastern Marketplace type-of-feel). Each marketplace Field will have a unique look and feel while still blending with the surrounding context of the plaza. Here is our current reference imagery for the field vision:\n\nStorefronts will be free. To be eligible for a Storefront, the associated Creator wallet address must have at least one creation published on the Marketplace for a minimum of 30 days, however this logic is subject to change based on community feedback. As more collections are introduced, more Storefronts will be dynamically added to the ever-expanding Marketplace Fields stacks. Over time, this will create an evolving form of dynamic architecture. Here’s our initial proof of concept that is still in development with a lot of room for expansion:\n\nStorefronts will be modular in design and Marketplace Creators will have the ability to choose from various visual layouts and styles. Marketplace visitors will be able to walk between each Storefront to discover new creators, collections, and explore what else the Marketplace Fields will offer. Our current implementation for each Storefront takes advantage of openly-available data via The Graph to verify all Creator wallets.\n\n**Quests & Beyond**\n\nSpeaking of additional content, aside from the core goals of the Marketplace, we also have numerous immersive experiences planned that we believe will bring Users back again and again to streamline ongoing engagement and a sense of progress (similar to other P2E games in Decentraland, however, this will not be a P2E game). There will be reward and leveling systems to incentivize further engagement within the Marketplace that will go hand in hand with quests:\n\nFor Phase I, there are 4 public quests planned:\nPlease read the Google Doc for the full breakdown (can't fit it here!)"},"discourse_topic_id":14393,"scores_total":13094984.612918315,"votes":187,"manaVP":4656945.090792408,"landVP":1582000,"namesVP":205900,"delegatedVP":6650139.522125906,"vesting_addresses":["0xC6A0cb9c60572631Af15D0556833e2e7f248d473"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"d233a938-2a8e-40ea-8957-e44c6f5c6ca7","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x5F2ABE4d5313D6818e1eecEF8cCD172217e07e05","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 6","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":3,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-03-07T00:29:55.877Z","pending_updates":3},{"id":"18c27260-17fb-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8","snapshot_id":"bafkreifwzkm7goar2ouxriohf7cenmr65vzd6lfjeddkis34bsf3kjcxra","user":"0xc82fd31500576f394b59be3b10c154b584ea6004","type":"grant","title":"SinfulMeatStick - Community Building, Onboarding, Education, and Growth","start_at":"2022-08-09T15:51:00.798Z","finish_at":"2022-08-23T15:51:00.797Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":60000,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"shelleyvan@songbirdcoagency.com","title":"SinfulMeatStick - Community Building, Onboarding, Education, and Growth","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Continuation of the SinfulMedia weekly shows, “Beyond The NFT” and “Decentraland Community Building” Twitter Spaces, for the next year. \n\nProvide community members who have presented Decentraland programming ideas a time slot to broadcast their show using the SinfulMedia RTMP server.\n \nCreation of “How To” videos, which include highly engaging, useful information for new users in web3 to utilize throughout their metaverse journey.","abstract":"SinfulMeatStick (Sinful) is a highly supportive, essential Decentraland (DCL) community builder and Twitch streamer.

We will also refactor our Demo Derby Game Mode as this has been the most difficult hurdle we have faced. We want to redesign the game mode with better technology. We will upgrade our other game modes and the gathering profession to provide variety in difficulty and experiences. We will also add in-game coin sinks with these upgrades.\n\nMarch 2023 & April 2023\nPhase  - New Game Modes and Player Ownership Value:\n\nPlayers have heavily requested two new game modes that are Drag Racing and a new version of our Grand Prix that was held in April of 2022. Drag Racing would be a linear sprint utilizing the infinity engine. It would be a point a to point b sprint with gear-shifting mechanics integrated. \nThe Grand Prix game mode would be an event every 6 months that supports up to 20 racers racing in an Indie 500-style race. \n\nMay 2023 & June 2023\nPhase 3 - Player Economy and Ownership Value:\n\nWe believe that the players are the most important part of our game aside from the fun factor. With this in mind, we want to always provide value both in the economy and the time spent in-game. We would like to introduce new ways to earn via mini-games that add more value to the main game modes.","abstract":"Vroomway is a racing game where players race and collect resources to craft their dual utility NFT. Our NFTs double as Skins and Vehicles. Players can race, craft, and upgrade completely free. We have a 4x4 estate that houses 6 different interactive instanced scenes. That’s a total 1,536 square meters packed with unique experiences. \n\nVroomway’s mission is to provide a safe haven for vehicle lovers and racers of all kinds.

A world created by machines for everyone to enjoy. Vroomway is the space station that bridges worlds all over the galaxy to Planeta Volo. This means the Planet of Speed in Latin. Vroomway provides the bridge to the future of what is possible. To inspire hope and encourage everyone to live in the moment and enjoy all the fun experiences life has to offer. \n\nVroomway is managed by a core team of 3 with our lead developer handling the infrastructure and back end. We have a community manager that is in charge of engaging our community on discord and in-game. Our community manager also helps onboard new players and provides community events to keep the core engaged. Our marketing person handles the social media accounts, and partner relationships and ideates/execute our marketing strategies. Our Project Manager manages and executes our business direction and project vision. They lead the game development process and 3D artwork development.\n\nVroomway has seen a gradual increase in our analytics since launching our Grand Opening on October 1st, 2022. Currently, we are seeing an average of 50 daily active users. Some days we peak at 150 while other days we valley at 43. On a monthly basis, we are seeing over 3700 sessions from our players. We expect to triple our Daily Active users over the next 3 months by fully utilizing our Social Friday experiences, consistent game releases, and upcoming partner collaborations. We plan to release a brand new Fuego Circuits track every month, and brand new vehicles and attributes often.\n\n### Milestones Achieved:\n\n- Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties, and build commissions. We have given 5% of those revenues back to the DAO total of $152.40 USDC over 3 months.\n- NFT floor prices rising as high as 750% on some vehicles.\n- Players have already earned 224 mana from crafting 7 of the 12 new skins/vehicles. The highest floor is currently 60 mana.\n- Twitter account nearing 600 followers.\n- Fully integrated 21 NFT-based vehicles with full functionality.\n- Two additional non-vehicle NFT-based wearables with full functionality.\n- Established a new sponsor: The Holy Ones to our 3 existing sponsors.\n- Created 3 Game Modes: Solo-Sprint, Demo Derby, and Fuego Circuits.\n- Created 5 different game tracks.\n- Integrated 9 different collectible resources and a robust crafting system.\n- Built an interactive club with Dance and Earn utility with live events and unique musical entertainment.\n- Held 3 different parties to celebrate the launch of each stage of the game with a DJ performance, and community giveaways - One for Alpha, Beta, and the launch.\n- Including performances by our own Nikki Fuego in Drag, bringing more Drag culture to Decentraland.\n- Organized 9 giveaways, of Beta wings, vehicles, and in-game rewards.\n- We started a 10-week tournament where we pick 1 winner with the fastest Solo-Sprint time and awarded 10 MANA. In our first 4 weeks, we have had 175 participants!\n- Started our weekly events with LIVE entertainment and giveaways.

We have an extremely unique setup with our instancing and require some outside skillsets to elevate parts of our infrastructure. Our integration with the Infinity Engine was a huge accomplishment and enhanced Vroomway’s original vision tenfold. We learned a lot with that integration and it has sparked even more innovation on how to develop this going forward. We would like to both upgrade and enhance the current game modes, but also release some community-suggested game modes that we believe will put Vroomway above par with previous racing games in the web3 industry. This new budget also allows the majority of our team to give more full-time attention to the project. \n\nWe have generated revenue consistently over 4 months and have generated revenue this month (November) as well.\n\nOur game generated over 2,500 MANA sales in wearables (primary and secondary combined). In addition, our players purchased 452 MANA worth of FUEL in-game. \n\nIt’s worth noting that since the beginning of our first grant we vowed to pay 5% of our revenue generated each month back to the DAO until the grant is paid back. We are keeping that vow with this grant as well. We have already shown good faith in this with 4 consecutive months of giving 5% back totaling $155~. Although a small amount, it shows that we can create revenue and eventually pay back the grants in full.\n\n## Budget Breakdown & Road Map:\n\nMarketing: $19,800 - 6 months\n\nPersonnel: $54,000 - 6 months\n\nDevelopment: $43,000 - 6 months\n\nUnexpected/Cushion: $3,200 - 6 months\n\nTotal: $120,000\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xqg7Qa2.png)\n\nWe have revised the previous budget to exclude 50% of the personnel cost, $30k in development cost, and 50% of the previous marketing budget."},"discourse_topic_id":16970,"scores_total":9682971.005358713,"votes":156,"manaVP":4709715.666278192,"landVP":720000,"namesVP":226000,"delegatedVP":3959338.3390805204,"vesting_addresses":["0xF265A437cC3566492221266B69ef69dd8936aa4c"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"87bd9271-b8f7-489e-8fd3-24925abda21c","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":6,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-06-19T03:13:46.092Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"4772fdb0-74e3-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556","snapshot_id":"0x9fb99be5b3bc14d42801984cd9209d2488dd33ce61013c729cb5f70fd8d89567","user":"0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d","type":"grant","title":"Governance Squad 1H2023 Renewal","start_at":"2022-12-05T21:25:00.347Z","finish_at":"2022-12-19T21:25:00.347Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":179360,"tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"gino@decentraland.org","title":"Governance Squad 1H2023 Renewal","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Our north star remains the same: **Continue improving the mechanisms for which the DAO Community engages with the governance process to lower the friction and increase the quality and frequency of contributions to the DAO**.

Funding from the DAO will enable MetaParty to develop a multifunctional space within Decentraland, where the team can increase the quality of MetaParty events. The team will conduct the following: \n\n1.\tMetaParty HQ:\nWithin the MetaParty HQ we intend to host 12 events per month including, dance parties, interactive mini game challenges and sponsored events. The build will have multiple levels and a user interface allowing players to easily teleport around the parcel and take part in multiple challenges. We intend to hire established artists from within the Decentraland community and onboard artists into Decentraland to perform at events. We intend to improve upon the MetaParty HQ over time.\n\n2.\tCyberStrife: RPG style Play-To-Earn game:\nOver the past four months, our team has been working hard to develop CyberStrife, a RPG-style Play-to-Earn game. We have released multiple versions of the game into Decentraland to gain feedback from the community. MetaParty has partnered with MetaZone to improve the experience of CyberStrife, by implementing a save game feature, NFT delegation feature and distributed version of the game. By having an array of diverse experiences in Decentraland, the team believes we will retain active users and build upon our community. By using a smart contract we will repay the DAO 10% royalties of all sales of the CyberStrife game. Furthermore, 10% of all CyberStrife and MetaParty merchandise will be sent to the DAO until the grant is fully repaid.\n\n3.\tMonthly Community Fashion Shows:\nThe MetaParty team aims to highlight and showcase different artists within this space through our unique “Community Fashion Show” event. Earlier this year, MetaParty worked directly with the Decentraland Foundation to host MetaVerse Fashion Week 2022 (MVFW), in which numerous artists showcase their wearables to the community. Due to the success of MVFW the MetaParty team reintroduced Community Fashion Shows, originally we asked creators within the space to sponsor the event in an effort to raise a prize pool for the audience. We realized that this model limits certain creators from participating. Moving forward Community Fashions Shows will be free of charge, and aim to capture the phenomenal work of wearable artists within this community.\n\n4.\tRegular Live stream and Podcasts:\nAs active YouTube and Twitch streamers, the MetaParty team (Rezinator and FriskyBumbleBee) has been creating live content surrounding topics and organizations within the Decentraland space, showcasing many individuals and organizations within this space and their hard work in getting to where they are today. The team believes that by providing engaging content and enabling collaboration between different organizations, we can potentially onboard and attract quality users into Decentraland.\n\n5.\tCross Metaverse Hub:\nThe team will engage in community outreach to new metaverses (spatial IO in particular) and create a cross-platform hub in the MetaParty HQ. By collaborating with community leaders within Spatial IO, the team believes it will increase the organic growth of new users in Decentraland. The goal is to not only create a hub located in the MetaParty HQ but to also collaborate with Spatial IO, creating a unique build within their platform; this will create a bridge between both metaverses, allowing multiple events to happen in both Decentraland and Spatial IO.","specification":"The MetaParty team will be working directly with MetaZone, achieving the following: implementing the save game feature, NFT delegation, listing the CyberStrife game for sale as a distributed version on the MetaZone website, redesigning the UI, ensuring data integrity and improving the game experience over time. The team will also create and release new NFTs, smart wearables, and create unique player experiences through the RPG system. We aim to collaborate with other Decentraland creators to bring more interoperability to DCL and diverse experiences which the team believes will assist in scalability and retention for the platform.\n\nThe CyberStrife RPG will be available to purchase on the MetaZone website as a Meta NFT. Owners of these NFTs can deploy the CyberStrife game to their land. Game data carries over between parcels and this offers landowners an opportunity to bring more foot traffic to their parcels. As previously mentioned, 10% of all CyberStrife game sales will be sent back to the DAO via smart contract until the grant is fully repaid.\n\nBy introducing the distributed CyberStrife game we aim to expand our team over time and embark on a road of becoming self-sustainable. The team aims to provide the utmost immersive experience for all citizens in Decentraland. The team will continue to create and host unique experiences with an aim to improve upon each event.\n\nIn addition, Community Fashion Shows are popular events within the Decentraland community and have been since MetaVerse Fashion Show 2022. The team will incorporate this as a continuous event that will be hosted once a month. A new build will be created by the team for each event and all community wearable / emote creators will be invited to walk the runway and showcase their designs for no charge. A prize pool will be allocated for each event, giving players an incentive to create and post Decentraland videos to Twitter and YouTube to win prizes. Furthermore, the entire audience will be invited to walk the runway at the end of the events and showcase their favorite outfits in the “Best Dressed Challenge”.\n\nYou can watch over 110 videos focused completely on Decentraland and MetaParty via The Rezinator's YouTube channel, furthermore FriskyBumbleBee has hosted over 25 streams centered around Decentraland on twitch, re-uploading those videos to YouTube.\n\nThe Rezinator:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73LJQ2EVw0whsh9gEKlMZQ\n\nFriskyBumbleBee:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjejVwNdLt36N1vel66M0w/videos\n\nBudget Breakdown: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QpxdThw-p91ZzBKc5f69KCh2THd4qFKNl4rpQApTTRU/edit#gid=0"},"discourse_topic_id":16678,"scores_total":4521671.2443501195,"votes":113,"manaVP":113703.97753870321,"landVP":314000,"namesVP":187000,"delegatedVP":3861918.2668114165,"vesting_addresses":["0x9df897aC547Fa1B469Db63cD3Ba200F25B59b68E"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"75290b5a-44e7-4fbb-a6dc-9d645fd2cbf3","size":60000,"beneficiary":"0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99C698d4B1FE1AA0599346","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":6,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-06-02T19:38:02.416Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"9d6efbe0-65d1-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d","snapshot_id":"0x296981153707d08faf8a4ce8c2a4ab5921c3fd9bd3ae1b0dbc1999ff47630b61","user":"0xb3197cad2032899ef2f33bf0e8a26f3ac5b48b03","type":"grant","title":"Genesis city map, 6-month renewal","start_at":"2022-11-16T17:10:00.222Z","finish_at":"2022-11-30T17:10:00.219Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":36300,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"seibo03@gmail.com","title":"Genesis city map, 6-month renewal","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"We will continue updating a weekly version of the map and creating an NFT on Rarible with the full map once per month.

During this period of time, this team was able to understand the grantees' needs, identified blockers and requests and provided solutions to the community. We have collaborated providing insights to the DAO Committee to [review Voting Power thresholds, the  grant's categories and budget requests to the Grants Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113). \n\nWe've classified the main issues from our grantees into four categories (Tech support, Financial Support, Promotion Support, and others). We wrote the [grant's FAQs](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/grants-faq/), to the DAO documentation to provide responses to recurrent questions. On the other hand, we have started to work on advisorships with the Decentraland Foundation's team to organize frequent calls for the 5 and 6 Tier Grants (platform category), and an [AskMeAnything sessions](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-decentraland-foundation-technical-ask-me-anything-sessions/) to connect the community with the Decentraland Foundation, based on 4 tech support topics (Catalyst, SDK, Explorer, and Dapps). These facilitations will begin in November 2022.\n\nAnother frequent request from our grantees has been promotion. We hired a copywriter (Luis Mienville) to write the #Community Highlights category (with the help of the Decentraland Foundation’s MKT team) on the Decentraland official Blog . We have published 6 articles and our idea is to have more frequency, having Luis as an internal member of the team. We also encouraged the creation of the 2nd monthly Town Halls (on European timezone), to have more grantees showing their progress. Since September, we have an average of 3 grantees showing their progress in each Town Hall, who create videos and chat with the community. Since the beginning of our grant period, 20 projects were highlighted in TownHalls. We work with the Gov Facilitation Squad to spread the videos everytime we can in Social Media, Discord and DAO Newsletter. \n\nTo take care of the community treasury, we have recommended to the DAO committee to revoke grants that were delayed, not delivering their grant projects, or unable to finish due to technical blockers, until they can deliver their commitment with the DAO. We helped to recover more than $565.842 to the DAO treasury during this 5 month period since the Grants Support Squad was created. [We are aware of the negative connotation of this action](https://mirror.xyz/0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5/74SS0fLMzAYS2m3noukxdsfsA3TjmOi3o6fSqolTjpQ) and that this method is not the best. But today, it is the only tool that we have to make sure the funds are going to projects that nurture our community. To decentralize this decision making, we asked who would be the best entity to revoke grants and [the community decided](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=823c92e0-2ad2-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0) to create a Revocation Committee to address these matters. They will be the stewards of the DAO treasury. \n\nLast but not least, we have collaborated with the DAO Facilitation Squad and the DAO Governance Squad to provide them with continuous feedback and partner with them to generate synergy among our efforts to build transparency in the community.","specification":"For this renewal, here are the goals, background, activities and methods we’d like to implement:\n\n\n**Support the grantees in Decentraland to make successful projects:** \nWe have supported +100 grantees, solving more than 80 requests and blockers and in the next 6 months we want to continue with this goal in mind, creating better and longer partnerships with the community. We are doing this by onboarding the new grantees, meeting virtually to provide support, constant communication on Discord/email, facilitating contacts, and creating strong relationships between Decentraland Foundation and our grantees to address blockers and requests. \n\n**Fostering transparency in the grants ecosystem:**\nIn the next 6 months, we want to keep on building along with the Governance App Squad a friendly platform for our grantees to post updates, communicate, receive feedback, support and review their project´s progress.\nOn this renewal, [we will work on requests for changes](https://www.figma.com/file/tL5dgm0VKP4J1JgSaHraPz/New-Grant-Request-Flow?node-id=0%3A1) to the form for requesting grants, that follow the Grants Framework, with the objective of giving the DAO more information about the grant being requested to have better context for voting. We are also requesting to implement a Final Report for the grants finished,  to understand how our grantees add value to Decentraland, and how our Grants program adds value to the community contributors. Measuring these impacts will help us understand the changes needed to make the Grants Program better in the future.\n\n\n**Guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury:**\nWe have been able to advise the DAO committee to execute preventive revocations for projects. This has been a difficult position, as it created friction on our relationship with some of our grantees. Nevertheless, all preventive revocations have been done with the commitment from the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee that if the grantees demonstrate that they deliver their projects, their vesting contracts would be resumed and paid fully. In this next period of 6 months, we will continue our efforts to design a [Framework for New Committee who decides when to revoke grants](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-275c146-framework-for-new-committee-who-decides-when-to-revoke-grants/16339), to provide transparency, decentralize the role of the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee, and start our role as providers of information to the New Committee. \n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.\nThe proposed DAO Grant Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are the same as the [previous grant.]( https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)"},"discourse_topic_id":16530,"scores_total":12073943.060899453,"votes":93,"manaVP":4710661.963463556,"landVP":480000,"namesVP":192000,"delegatedVP":6669953.097435896,"vesting_addresses":["0x590be97D060D09c965Ec5b37FD7B8785A7b90A3B"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"2584a1d6-30ee-4215-9383-6c8cc1dbb573","size":103200,"beneficiary":"0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":4,"late_updates":2,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-05-19T18:50:21.111Z","pending_updates":0,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x590be97d060d09c965ec5b37fd7b8785a7b90a3b","vesting_released":103200,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-11-22T20:56:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-05-21T20:56:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":103200,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.966666666666667}]},{"id":"aaabc360-5c17-11ed-9128-d95e3b6d7912","snapshot_id":"0x8b7d45643eba8a9e9c1cc44871dc38063aac494520ab449ce4cbb3115c4f9bd8","user":"0x76d429836cf2d4944a5e4ec689271151f877b252","type":"grant","title":"A dedicated reporter will publish 30 articles about Decentraland DAO for 90 days","start_at":"2022-11-04T08:07:00.575Z","finish_at":"2022-11-11T08:07:00.573Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":1500,"tier":"Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment","email":"contact@daotimes.com","title":"A dedicated reporter will publish 30 articles about Decentraland DAO for 90 days","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"In total our reporter will publish 30 articles for 90 days, he also will share each article via his Twitter profile.

I'll be working with several creators from the community to create sets of assets (enemies, towers, and environments) to be included in this module; providing our community with paid jobs, work experience, and providing them with an opportunity to display their talents!","category":"Gaming","personnel":"Hi, I’m Alex; I’ll be managing the development process, as well as tackling the module's programming implementation.\n\nI've been programming and developing projects for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community. I have already created several projects on the platform and I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the goals of this project is to provide an opportunity for Decentraland’s creators to showcase their talents. With that in mind, I’ve on-boarded some talented community members who will be working on generating the project’s graphical assets!\n\nArtist Core:\n   CG-KING -  (Instagram)[https://www.instagram.com/mabanoking/]\n   Emilie\n   Jacko\n   Ottonamas\n   Jetrolee\n   Finegrapgh\n\nI feel this is the best direction to take in regards to the creation and composition of the project’s team.

After the module has been successfully developed and tested (at the close of this proposal’s term), we’ll be able to consider populating the creation kit with additional industry-grade assets.","beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","description":"Tower defence games are a staple genre of gaming culture. The genre is so popular that fans have made variants of tower defence in nearly every RTS game that offers modding capabilities; some of these fan projects have even pivoted to become full standalone games (now that is dedication!). Decentraland has seen several different types of games break into the scene over the course of the platform’s development, but the foundations for tower defence games have never been cemented. I see this as a major missed opportunity not only for players, but also for creators and land owners within Decentraland.\n\nThe value provided by this project would benefit 3 major audiences: users, creators, and land owners. The created tower defence game fields would provide general users of Decentraland with a fun activity to partake in, while the developed creation kit could be used by creators to generate additional tower defence content. Land owners would be able to leverage the kit by hosting tower defence games on their land, likely monetizing access to premium content or wearables themed around their fields. On top of that, if we can achieve a baseline ecosystem for developing a self-propelling system of user developed content we would be able to apply that blueprint to other game genres.\n\nThis project will also provide important jobs and invaluable experience to Decentraland community creators. It is absolutely imperative that our community’s skill-level and proficiency in creating for the Decentraland platform is fostered and continues to grow. If developers cannot source resource creation from our community: they will either go elsewhere or choose to conduct their projects in a more developed metaverse. The deliverable tower and enemy assets outlined in this project will be developed and optimised specifically for the platform, giving an in-depth example of how to make assets for Decentraland.\n\nThe tower defence creation kit will provide everything a user needs to create their own tower defence field (from tower placement to enemy wave generation). The interfaces will be as simplified as possible and heavily documented to ensure users with no coding experience can still create their dream TD fields. The kit will also come pre-packed with the required assets to create a tower defence game (enemies, towers, etc), all for unlimited free use.\n\nAfter development of the kit has completed, four tower defence fields will be made using the creation kit. These game fields will be made available as open-source repositories, as well as being hosted for play by any user in Decentraland. This will allow any user looking to host a tower defence field on their land to do so with minimal effort. It also provides a great starting point for anyone looking to create their own tower defence field, as users will be free to customise/monitise these scenes or any derived scenes in any way they wish.\n\nIf we can capture the attention of even a small portion of the gaming audience by providing entertaining experiences and empowering tools then that would be a huge win for our community. By nurturing a thriving community of players and creators, we would see the constant generation of new content to attract more users to Decentraland. As we break into new genres of gaming the community (and amount of accessible content in Decentraland) would only grow. While this will likely take significant time and effort, we can begin to lay the foundations for community-based games now.","specification":"### Tower Defence Kit Assets:\n\nThe kit will include a set of standard assets for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. These will be designed to be as light-weight while still maintaining a quality appearance, ensuring in-scene resources are not misspent and acceptable performance can be maintained. Everything included in the creation kit will also be open source and made completely available to the community for use in other projects or games (including monetized scenes).\n\nThese assets will include vital components (models, animations, etc) following a single systemic doctrine that, when followed, would allow additional assets to easily be added to the module by users. Their raw pieces (such as UVs, textures, and .blend) will also be made available along-side the project in an additional compressed file. These resources will be extremely useful to anyone looking to modify existing assets or developing their own assets for the creation kit.\n\n### Tower Defence Kit Functionality:\nThe kit will provide all required functionality for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. The interfaces for the kit should be easy to interact with and as hands-off as possible, enabling creators who do not have programming experience.\n\n#### Proposed Functionality:\n   - Tower Management: de/construction and upgrade towers that interact with enemies via classic tower defence mechanics (ie: direct damage, damage over time, movement slow).\n   - Enemy Management: enemy wave generation and spawn handling, as well as handling enemy entity specifics such as health, movement, and death.\n   - Economy Management: earn points by defeating enemies and clearing waves; spend points on building new towers and fortifying existing ones.\n   - Difficulty Management: modify the game’s ecosystem with variances to provide more/less challenge through different difficulties. (An additional feature I'd like to add, if I everything goes smoothly, is the inclusion of challenge modes where the player must complete game fields under certain constraints; something like 1-life mode).\n\nThroughout development modularity will remain a key requirement of the kit. While most users will likely be satisfied with the provided features, others might want to add their own functions/assets to the project. This process must be made as easy as possible: adding new assets to the project (such as towers and enemies) should require very little effort and only minimal knowledge of programming. Assets will be loaded at run-time through definition files targeting external assets, meaning users will only need to interact with a json file in order to add more turrets or enemies to the mix.\n\n### Tower Defence Fields:\nFour playable tower defence fields will also be produced with the tower defence creation kit during the project’s course. These will not only showcase the kit’s functionality, but also provide an example of how to put a tower defence game together. Like the creation kit, these playable fields will be provided through open-source GitHub repositories. Instances of these scenes will also be hosted and maintained so users can play some Decentraland Tower Defence anytime they wish!\n\nAs with previous projects, all produced content will be monitored and maintained to keep them relevant and functional within the Decentraland platform.

This module currently provides all functions required for users to create their own parkour stages in Decentraland. Parkour stages can be made up of several different platform types (static, moving, rotating, and blinking) and can be separated across several different sets (allowing for different difficulties of the same stage). \n\nThe proposed expansion would add in-scene collectibles, death mechanics, and a checkpoint respawn system to the current list of features. Creators would be able to use these systems to gamify their stages by providing completion challenges and respawn locations for when the player reaches a failure point (e.g. falling in lava).","category":"Gaming","personnel":"I'll be working on this project individually. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community so we can pro. I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line and I have already completed several projects on the platform.\n\nYou can also play some of my previously developed projects here:\n\n[Minesweeper](https://decentraland-minesweeper.herokuapp.com/)\n\n[Solitaire](https://decentraland-solitaire.herokuapp.com/)","beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","description":"Parkour is prevalent throughout the internet and gaming culture. It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts; developing this module further would enhance the experience that can be created through this kit.\n\nYou can view the module here: [Repo](https://github.com/TheCryptoTrader69/Decentraland_ParkourKit) and [Live Scene](https://decentraland-parkour-kit.herokuapp.com/)\n\nThe current set of features allows users to fully create their own parkour stages. The module’s implementation also massively reduces the level of programming knowledge required to create their own stages. However, the module currently lacks game elements associated with the parkour/platformer genre, such as collectible objects and death/respawn mechanics. These elements can be successfully reproduced in tandem with the module, but are not baked into the kit and many users will likely lack the required skills needed to craft these features on their own.\n\nThis proposal is meant to remedy those gaps by providing access to those systems in a similar manner to the platform creation interface. Users would be able to define and place collectibles (coins, relics) around their parkour courses, create traps/zones to kill players, and checkpoints for the player to respawn at when they are killed; all through the modification of simple files.","specification":"This module currently allows users to set up dynamic parkour courses made up of varying platform types. The relatively complex systems that make up these core utilities have been hidden from the user by providing them with simple interfaces to define and generate their platforms for the parkour stage. By providing the power of the SDK through interfaces, users can take advantage of its power without requiring advanced programming knowledge. Advanced users can also easily modify the module to fit their own needs by adding new platform visual styles or movement types.\n\nThe planned features for this expansion are:\n\n   Collectibles System: users will be able to define and place collectibles around their parkour stages. Collectibles can be defined in different tiers/types, allowing users to place higher tier collectibles in hard to reach locations. These will be placed in the game space and collected when a player touches them. The system will also provide a count of gathered and remaining collectibles on the player’s HUD, providing the player with feedback on how much of the course remains and when it has been successfully completed.\n\n   Death Mechanics and Respawn System: Users will be able to create deadly traps/death zones around their stages to defeat players and provide respawn locations for the player. Checkpoints can also be used to modify player respawn locations (allowing players to save their progress as they adventure through the parkour stage).\n\n   A scene will also be produced using the module to showcase these features and providing an example of how to create a parkour stage with the kit. The current theme of the scene is Jungle Temple, featuring 2 tiers of in-game collectibles and several trap types (e.g. spikes, blow darts). This scene will be hosted along-side the current example scene, through its own repository (the more content/examples the better)."},"discourse_topic_id":16131,"scores_total":1883587.376950116,"votes":63,"manaVP":97278.76532425758,"landVP":178000,"namesVP":138400,"delegatedVP":1450869.6116258586,"vesting_addresses":[],"enacting_tx":"0xd1b5f2e9868e38eb2093182cc83c091e0a159d84d87f9a2826ad924f3c40608f","project_id":"6af3f5ba-f4cc-493b-a797-76fc799ec815","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 2","done_updates":2,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-11-13T23:19:41.697Z","pending_updates":0},{"id":"cedb3ff0-53d8-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004","snapshot_id":"0x6a7d8f91558df48bcad58171e026cb0c5cf9d15898bd5afb497262fdadbc433e","user":"0x7c127c92eba3f5a321116c59ef5da709e61c0af0","type":"grant","title":"Competition prizes and contender shirt for Rock, Paper, Scissors","start_at":"2022-10-24T20:16:00.687Z","finish_at":"2022-10-31T20:16:00.686Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":3000,"tier":"Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment","email":"surdegens@gmail.com","title":"Competition prizes and contender shirt for Rock, Paper, Scissors","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Competition.

The main system creates game tables that can host several different types of card games and an effort has been made to optimise the code to reduce the strain on scene resources. The module also features two fully incorporated card games (Patience and FreeCell Solitaire), showcasing its current functionality.\n\nBy expanding the community card game module and adding additional card games we can further test the limitation of the current set of utilities, as well as providing more content for the platform.

Knowing this, MetaTrekkers wants to become the platform that brings the artist and metaverse-user communities together and rewards them for their participation in various series of entertainment events, sessions and talks.\nThe grant would cover the development, marketing and advertising of the events and innovative features aimed at improving the Decentraland user experience.\nBy expanding the brand awareness of Decentraland as a user engagement-focused metaverse, we are reaching out to new users interested in onboarding and attracting a new, important target – brands looking to adopt new “customer journey” technologies and solutions.\nTurning art and entertainment series like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music Concerts or the BeatTrekkers DJ Battles into Decentraland resident events, we are ensuring a constant flow of metaverse newcomers originating from the artists’ fanbase. As a fresh experience for a new user, we want to offer a full range of engaging performances and means for them to showcase their art, all while being rewarded for their activity with metaverse-specific benefits provided by a large network of partner locations and projects spread all over Decentraland.\nEstablishing MetaTrekkers as an artist and entertainment platform, which constantly develops new concepts based on community involvement, will provide a ramp for Decentraland to multiply its reach and an incentive for artists and fans alike to discover the endless possibilities featured in a socially active, virtual environment. The possibility for the Decentraland DAO and the platform to become a hub for visionary artists who want to explore the virtual environment and experiment together with their following, relies on investing in the proper partnership and communication opportunities, like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music collaboration and the development of a Decentraland onboarding standard, which will be made available to all Decentraland venues through an open-source kit.\nThe funds from the DAO grant will serve to build the platform as a self-sustainable project that represents a portal for artists and fans across the planet, and from other metaverses, to access Decentraland and make it the go-to virtual world for entertainment and arts.","specification":"To paint a clear picture of the importance held by the MetaTrekkers events regarding onboarding new users into Decentraland and building an organic community, we must start from the beginning of our metaverse entertainment journey.\n\nDubfest\nOur first step into the (big) live events territory was when the MetaTrekkers Clubhouse hosted the 24 hour / 24 artists Dub Fest, the first event of its kind in the metaverse, which brought over 300 visitors to the Decentraland location, out of which we succeeded to convert into Decentraland regular users around 80%.\n\nVenice Music\nThe MetaTrekkers entertainment journey continued with a partnership that emphasizes the overall importance our initiative holds in regard to making the Decentraland metaverse known and accessible to new target audiences. We are talking about the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music series of concerts. It is worth mentioning that this music label was founded by Troy Carter, former manager for artists like Eve, John Legend and Lady Gaga, and one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to direct their business towards web3, through an NFT-gated, professional collective.\n\nThe first concert of the series also brought a strategic collaboration for MetaTrekkers – teaming up with Decentral Games in order to offer the best onboarding experience for all the fans who wanted to attend their favorite artist’s concert but were new to the metaverse. To put it into numbers, the first MetaTrekkers x Venice Music concert has given us the opportunity to reach a new audience of 2.5 million social media accounts (all four artists’ following combined).\n\nYossy Concert\nThe next milestone of our Decentraland entertainment adventure was an important event for the Latinx NFT music scene, and it was marked by a special concert featuring Yossy, a Latinx musician and first-time metaverse performer. This event has allowed us to reach a new, niche audience of over 12k followers, of which some became Decentraland users after receiving their metaverse onboarding.\n\nBeatTrekkers\nCurrently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it engages twelve competing artists, guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences – the participating artists’ metaverse-newbie fans and general public interested in the benefits associated with NFT music and being part of a developing metaverse community.\n\nSince our aim is to give back to the community as much we can, one of the main rewarding ideas within BeatTrekkers is to give fans and supporters access to the artists’ work, well beyond the live performances, in the form of wearables, NFTs and private lessons led by the artists themselves. The BeatTrekkers series has the potential to become a platform for Decentraland to onboard big names in the music industry. \n\nIn order to make this happen, we are requesting a grant of $120,000 USD. This funding will be used to cover the costs of marketing, event production and artist fees. We believe that this grant will pay off in the form of increased awareness and adoption of Decentraland, as well as providing a fun and immersive experience for art and music fans. The users already onboarded through our program have bought Decentraland parcels, created and submitted wearable designs, also play an active role on the wearable purchase and minting market."},"discourse_topic_id":15361,"scores_total":7571964.079212305,"votes":174,"manaVP":176535.56876247557,"landVP":3812000,"namesVP":234400,"delegatedVP":3349028.5104498286,"vesting_addresses":["0x0BB8270345bf29c2Bb57c84E454830C4a0A6BaF4"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"fc0f8f63-5955-42bb-b1aa-f3e6fa0d815d","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":3,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-01-03T02:33:10.641Z","pending_updates":3,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x0bb8270345bf29c2bb57c84e454830c4a0a6baf4","vesting_released":60804.529320987655,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-10-03T12:26:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-04-01T12:26:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":60804.529320987655,"vesting_status":"Revoked","duration_in_months":5.935483870967742}]},{"id":"1117c6c0-3ced-11ed-a2ad-25cde07289d9","snapshot_id":"0x44a2954eea6259e92344f2ac12d745986ce8c494409a474f9dc3dc5aede7fa02","user":"0x2e09a10eaace1ef3a66fbf6f1f782c8c0cb8c942","type":"grant","title":"Dungeons and Dragons & Decentraland (Demo)","start_at":"2022-09-25T16:14:00.004Z","finish_at":"2022-10-02T16:14:00.003Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":5000,"tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"cenmodelscontact@gmail.com","title":"Dungeons and Dragons & Decentraland (Demo)","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"### Estimated Timeline: 2 months ###\n\n1 month:\n\nBasic 3d models, 2d images of characters, sounds\n\n2 months:\n\nProgramming, animation, remaining 3d models, 2d elements","abstract":"__Dungeons and Dragons__ is played worldwide by an enormous range of players and it is no less intriguing to watch others play as evidenced by the great success of organizations such as Critical Role. __We believe a good implementation of this concept has the power to introduce many new users to Decentraland!__","category":"Gaming","personnel":"### Core team ###\n\n__Soulsinger__ - manager of the CEN studio; game designer;\nthe ideological inspirer of the project\n\n__Dax__ - SDK Developer\nIn Decentraland since 2017;\n10 years of software development experience;\nwinner of the 2022 DCL Game Jam\n\n__Casuallvl__ & __Orina__ - 3d artists.\nSpecialists in 3D modelling of low-poly objects\n\n__Master Eador__ - Gamemaster.\nLongtime TTRPG player;\n2 years experience as a professional gamemaster\n\n__Mia__ - 2d artist.\nArt student with experience in building game assets\n\n__Alexander__ - Sound designer.\nKnown in some circles as ‘The Man with Three Ears’\n\n### Relevant experience ###\n\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years.

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Therefore, for an ordinary user, Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from them - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Previous proposal ###\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=12f794f0-167a-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8\n\n### TL;DR changes in the resubmission ###\n\nThe updated budget focuses on creating a demo version to demonstrate the gameplay\n\n### Examples of game assets ###\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join it. The purpose of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a lot of new users to Decentraland.\n\nDungeons and Dragons inspired the game we want to create. But it won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some game mechanics so that it fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience. \n\n### Scope ###\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~ 2 months. We want to release a demo version of our game during this period.\n\n### Duration ###\n\nThe demo's duration will be short (~ 10 minutes) but intense. During this time, users will get familiar with the main mechanics, various 3D models, animation, and sound design.\n\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7EB5l6wYrQHUMBKflUXrE0W4doMiOe6x7XZngXmmsWSLC9MD_Ckme2jDb37mrCRsBJYcbuaCjl_KtKRss6U5GX93en814fWk4WWjMMKhOvWQ2ypYH-BEjhiIR5rdWSthFoo43pKP9Gpv0adklWXlSjePiZVTHu0ZR43PaAnoPQJgxSu_DFRwDwH9cxsmvWJWbpb8EvEQFRMqrGSkIwltB5LcQMImKEm7ah6jVMSIoFMq0GsV3ybVIM3oXlOv96hA7fRKDWdfzTnxKXVJ0iv3iwic7aWSsA-gtBQ8kkcamc6dSJiaBbIba33C1FA1QvlVoLDJuoFLSFCudzLqkdbyGs51ZUOBAthM21eca4v5PQgEZZsJuoPEW3znY8oBZxXpt2Lb8j3dTXW3yHGyh9u7JFcxkya1FrTx3hx_GM_sqHCaI-e58KIHPS6zsdZOHRhjc1_5sS-wdzyT92Rnf1pn4S-ozvJ0q5jpEX1fRuwoqWu0YskM6jvCRI-CTgHw6zRN8PmJYNoFHlBvZZOkjjIHU3yL8Fw4lBRsNm4M-Bs0eKQiOqEVzPLljB1fdlXE-UIKEodKJaBPDsUe4ajLYA9clfoIhb-XTmAYFjTKW9DEr93LtmcYW9-r1amv1WuYq7UtYb3SitV3TGBqCmb0W1ji1f03IRGdRiRFTcjXYxSRr4Po-AMZ5n6NMkdMwmDqwvMGravsEZS1d4u5kxYS-UFdewt6rc8eGiLpkqJrWbZDWafLydxKlefYmUzDl1dIgGnaEUd2e4QeVJvzYjpk-wo3W3nk4T-dXOodxqGiHq7oV-5jRPPo6pWYRx36OWWeYOhjpq9LJgNc8FH8DQAER31cQELhRTFKaNN9ly8ketZmigiVD4aCcbNFXw_nWlQPKrdvZ2nkorFHrN0LOoaNlphyjUajD5f3MzpDYznrpw6yvIfbMaNS7zZohy16Nf7l4dMMk9xCl2gdMus=w725-h940-no?authuser=1)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R2mRAshZLTtMkBkLr8Y8y7_cYmHSSnAnjU9Z5J64qTfwqAGLKG4okCdfZ7-ROYTFxwBXGh3UxogM1ZTnBcUjTmK440WOWsYKnJANgBa8Kk1Ne2oGi5hbPc2TTpBcD07cHSbX4zEeOBP62usewJkfhqD1AnuTkxbgkTljnICaJ8TXLdFo8iu-Cqb4LBtv8SDtReEgXDznyTA8OAnm1wA942NfhXM28ufF1ITuJ-BPqnilykzT1SMwWjlJsZS_-BjiOzpNgMxpuSWWqU0Umwmj_bkQ6QV1i1cZodsHFbRDKw7WeGowDwdqDQzgojRB8QwtkV5cCT7SMpzjqjCJby2a7vEHz5ixVMHLGKei0XEHGwBXv5CnKAoBpRmIAkIAhxbABSabU4kc0XSc6ZIjWJ3VZQvf3u3Jdo_JWV8jhwnMBLoLaLdUc5Xf2I0QtMUNmjjqHCMOrnA0o2ENILFPrCRiGp1RxRQ-g-AcuBERHoNoRLSzlWHdkQAfUQ7BAwnpK24eF7RjITfojoha48vwyaKjlL51nzi5oDh0YLxW5KiX9nCEnM-P6taYic7q29TvVnJdPozqYdfpGoMyszIIfj-ViDe_WNzZqntyDNQ4UFCuqwjNGc_YW_NYbZfvktL8yqBaBJkgdWegjFTJarbo7zl89QhpXfTpY8a7RcGKwuTAMlBYvCA1AsfbeqAtjIKVlg1QBUxUGCNNJbazy48sl5VP6dJB3TSw90tP_CfSipfgtDavWUZKbnrPloYph7iWwBMxrWSXrmqHdOS2g-qbN220CODXf-qb4nAx=w725-h940-no?authuser=1)","specification":"### How we see the final result: ###\n\nThe player enters the adventurers guild.

Since we already have a head start on it, as well as the chess game, the team may at times work on different projects simultaneously in order to avoid bottlenecks. For example, 3D modelers might begin building out the comedy club venue and escape room environment while devs code the nuts and bolts of the racing and chess games that already have some of the visual foundation built. We will converge when possible in order to focus all efforts on completing one deliverable from the list at a time in a top-down manner. \n\nIn terms of ETA's, we will deliver all projects within a 6 month timeframe. We expect the escape room to take the longest since it is the most complex build, and will be built from scratch, so we estimate 3 months for it.

In 2019 he founded NFT World (https://nftworld.io/) to promote brands in the Metaverse. Since then, Doug and team have created various DCL scenes that now comprise NFT World City and have also built:\n\nMetaverse Chat (https://metaversechat.io/) - Incorporates Decentraland avatar profiles into a blockchain-based chat app.\nMetaverse Browser Extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metaverse/nghkdhckeabmkjbklgocfoojnpchhlgc) - Makes it easier to navigate resources for Decentraland and other virtual worlds in the Metaverse.\nMetaverse Coin (https://mtvrs.com/) - Handed out at NFT World City events to incentive attendance.\nMTVRS Market (https://market.mtvrs.com/) - Offers utility for Metaverse Coin by allowing holders to exchange the coin for NFT World avatar wearables which can then be sold for other currency on the Decentraland Marketplace or OpenSea.\n\nThe team consists of freelancers sourced from platforms like Upwork as well as some of the best known experts from within the Decentraland community. We have talent that covers all of the required key skill areas for building within Decentraland - developers, 3D modelers, graphic designers, etc. Which specific individuals will assist with each project associated with this proposal will be determined once it passes, but the core team will include trusted partners that we have already worked with in the past.","beneficiary":"0x79fF1B31D61c73f993e0743897eA4B51E53C4e1b","description":"NFT World City is hosted in Aetheria District at 150,65 - a huge 11x11 (121 parcels) two-level city that is the single largest scene hosted in Decentraland to date. The city was designed to serve as a spot where visitors are incentived to attend events in order to generate traffic. Sponsors pay to host events, attendees earn a reward for attending them which generates traffic, and this traffic then draws interest from other brands looking for exposure. Brands can also establish a more permanent residence by leasing space within the city. Spaces include art galleries, NFT storefronts, brand headquarters, games, and more.\n\nWith this grant, we are proposing:\n\n1. Completion of a racing game where players race each other around a track. We have already built a track that runs around the perimeter of the Chicago area in the city, and we already have the ability to change avatars into Battle Racers vehicles. Next steps that this grant will help us achieve is turning all of this into a game with free/paid races, prize distribution, leaderboard, additional vehicle choices, and choice of environment. Vehicle choices will include DCL skins as well as integration of external NFT projects (such as we have already done with the TKING Bugatti). Environment choices could include ideas like UFO crash site, apocalypse, or seasonal decor.\n\n2. Turning the Mehak Jain Gallery chessboard collaboration into a playable game. Users will have the choice to play for free, or to compete for prizes in exchange for a gameplay fee. A leaderboard will keep track of player's win/loss ratio. Players enjoy a more immersive Alice in Wonderland kind of experience from controlling their pieces from inside the game rather than looking top down at the board.\n\n3. Comedy club venue which will host playlists of pre-recorded sets as well as live-streamed shows. We are hosting playlist content already for our partners at Comedy Hub, but it is located in the stadium alongside music playlists. The grant money will go toward a dedicated space for comedy shared by multiple partners - bringing the best all in one place. Content will be updated regularly so that audiences have fresh selection to choose from in order to encourage repeat visits. The club will be decorated with humorous atmosphere and a classy vibe that is friendly for all ages. Comedy sets will be clearly marked and categorized by level of vulgarity/maturity so that users can filter for the type of comedy that suits their personal preference.\n\n4. Escape room where players must work together to solve a mystery in order to find their way out of a precarious situation. The theme of this build will be a Cursed Egyptian Tomb. But it'll be built in such a way that we will be able to replicate important parts of it for other themes as well in the future. Abandoned Spaceship Mission? Murder Mystery Mansion? Jungle Temple? The possibilities are endless.\n\nEach of these will be built on 2x2 estates already available within the city.","specification":"Racing game - 2x2 multilevel racetrack. Up to 4 racers per track. Racers choose between different environments to race around. The track remains the same for each environment. Users can also choose their vehicle. There will be 5-10 Battle Racers vehicles to choose from by default. We will also integrate DCL avatar skins to increase vehicle selection even further which can include animals, mythical creatures, planes, spaceships, or anything else that the community comes up with. Vehicle speed will remain the same regardless of the type. A leaderboard will record fastest race times. All races must finish by a certain time (5 minutes?). Users cannot go backward, only forward, in order to prevent shortcuts to the finish line. Falling off the track results in starting at the beginning again. Racers will need to balance risk of falling off while going too fast, versus going slow and staying on the track but then risk getting passed up by other racers. Gameplays will be free and paid. Winners of free gameplays receive no prize. Winners of paid gameplays receive a large share of the gameplay fees, and second place earns their gameplay fee back.\n\nChess game - 2x2 chessboard. Players control their pieces from inside the game. Hovering over a piece highlights the squares that the piece is able to be moved to, and then the destination square becomes clickable. Upon choosing the destination square, the piece then follows a path to it. If an enemy piece is already present on the same square, it is removed from the game. Captured enemy pieces from each team are tracked in the UI. Players may compete for free, or pay a gameplay fee. Winners of paid games will receive their gameplay fee back as well as a portion of the other player’s gameplay fee. Top ranked players will be shown on a leaderboard.\n\nComedy club - 2x2 venue. A shared club for multiple comedians and comedy groups. Each will have their own playlist for videos that will be shown on a screen (similar to the music playlists in the stadium). The club will have dedicated space for different comedic content. For example, family-friendly content will be separate from adult content. We will live stream sets as well to bring audiences together in a more social format for enjoying comedy. Amateur nights will give lesser known comedians some spotlight. Comedians that contribute content will be allowed to advertise their upcoming events and link out to their social media accounts.\n\nEscape room - 2x2 environment. A collaborative experience where players work together to solve a mystery in order to escape the scene alive within a certain timeframe (30 minutes?). An archaeologist has gone missing and the team needs to figure out what happened, and then escape before suffering the same ill fate. A journal is found with some clues. It contains deciphered hieroglyphics with captions like “curse”, “sickness”, “death” which look similar to some of those inscribed on the tomb walls. Some of the pages also contain rough sketches of artifacts and a partial map. A raspy voice on a recording seem to indicate some instructions on what to do with these materials. There will be a gameplay fee but no rewards for successful escapes. Parts of the game may be randomized in order to curb cheating, but unlike a P2E game, the goal for this one is to create a fun experience that encourages players to bring back more family/friends to share it with regardless of the outcome of their game."},"discourse_topic_id":15208,"scores_total":4688683.201457248,"votes":144,"manaVP":169058.14110577936,"landVP":1076000,"namesVP":237200,"delegatedVP":3206425.060351469,"vesting_addresses":["0x9A78B7a9b0d44A1139B3C1568bF02873db2a363C"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"84653319-b319-472d-b960-b71e9b3d785e","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0x79fF1B31D61c73f993e0743897eA4B51E53C4e1b","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":5,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-03-28T19:21:02.679Z","pending_updates":0,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x9a78b7a9b0d44a1139b3c1568bf02873db2a363c","vesting_released":120000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-09-28T20:17:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-03-27T20:17:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":120000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.964285714285714}]},{"id":"92cb8d40-36fe-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8","snapshot_id":"bafkreiffcsufcnqf6ns4eeqevyeiy6ue4z7ehkmhfdv3pyb7w4pqi4jjcm","user":"0x17a6ba0b9cc209ec061ba117769ec7e9a30a0952","type":"grant","title":"Introduce New Artists into Decentraland","start_at":"2022-09-18T03:04:00.076Z","finish_at":"2022-09-25T03:04:00.073Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":3000,"tier":"Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment","email":"digifundao@gmail.com","title":"Introduce New Artists into Decentraland","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Before receiving funds, we developed abundant experience in Decentraland through making wearables, hosting events, and working with different designers and venues.

To achieve this, it is necessary to create interactive experiences that **increase traffic and help onboarding the masses** to ***Decentraland***.\n\n**Espacio Creador’s main premise is to create new opportunities** for artists through the convergence of art and technology and the development of multiverse experiences that leverage Decentraland, NFTs, VR and AR to take the next step towards the real adoption of Web 3.0.\n\nThe **pilot for the project** will be a **phygital event** taking place in Decentraland, the website of Espacio Creador (https://escreador.wtf), as well as in real life at Simonette Boutique in Bogota, Colombia (https://simonetteboutique.com/). The event will have live Djs (both in real live and in the metaverse),  live street art/VR performance from renowned Colombian artists such as Ceroker https://www.instagram.com/ceroker/, Tres Manos Studio  https://www.instagram.com/atresmanosestudio/, and the launch of a wearable collection by Kaftan https://kaftan.com.co/. \n\n**The Espacio Creador is conceived as a space for co-creation and promotion of creative disciplines**, covering the areas of design, technology, fashion, plastic- , visual- , sound- , interactive arts and new media.\n\nIt aims to **enable environments where these areas converge, allowing experimentation and creation**. These environments will be focused on strengthening the culture and art of developing cultures as well as their recognition both locally and internationally. In addition to this, **Espacio Creador aims to strengthen the art industry through the creation of innovative diffusion channels which allow new ways to perceive and consume culture.** \n\nTo this end, the creative space offers a series of environments and channels, both digital and physical, which together form an ecosystem of extended interaction, with the intention of covering a wide range of artistic intentions. The Espacio Creador will take three main channels into consideration to allow the interaction between creators, enthusiasts and art buyers:\n\n- Metaverse=\n\n1. Decentraland\n\n- Digital Realm=\n\n1. Dapps\n2. Virtual Reality\n3. Augmented Reality\n4. RRSS\n\n- Physical Realm=\n1. Galleries\n2. Events\n3. Performances\n4. Print media\n\nRegarding the metaverse diffusion channel we chose Decentraland because of its advanced state of development, thriving community, real decentralised character and huge upside potential.","specification":"**Concept**\n\nThe creative space in Decentraland is conceived as a hybrid minimalist building with big exhibition floors. The experience aims to prioritise the exhibition spaces by using large rooms that are interconnected by floating corridors, offering the visitor a dynamic tour through the building\n\n**Architecture**\n\n- The architectural style for the creative space is inspired in minimalist futurism with large geometrically oriented spaces, viewpoints and external corridors with a dynamic character.\n\n- Given the technical limitations and the planned aesthetic for the experience, we will develop orthogonal geometric forms with bevels, and a high presence of diagonals that dynamize the forms without overloading the mesh with polygons.\n\n- We will build large halls that highlight the work exhibited in conjunction with the architecture. These halls will be connected by open-air elevated corridors with platforms, floating walls  and terraces with a minimalist futuristic touch.\n\n- We seek to experiment with sculptural ornaments embedded in the architecture that give a certain personification to the space, and that end up constituting a differentiating style with other spaces in Decentraland.\n\n\n**Exhibition Spaces**\n\n- 16:9 Rooms - 16:9 aspect ratio rooms that allow the best possible portrayal of works of this size.\n\n- Floating Walls - Walls that are not connected to the rest of the building in any way, and that show exhibition screens or sculptures in ways that would be impossible in reality.\n\n- Transparent Ceilings and Floors - In some rooms we will look for works to be displayed on the ceiling and on second floor layers that can be observed from a specific viewing angle.\n\n- Large screens - The aim is to introduce large screens with animated or video content to create an object that can be appreciated for a long time. \n\n**Tour**\n\nThe primary goal of the tour is to offer the visitor an experience of non-linear prolonged interest, that can be explored in different ways and which captures the attention of the observer due to its dynamic character. This tour will take the visitor through rooms of different dimensions and distributions, through long corridors and surfaces with characteristics similar to those of platform games, which force the user to jump, eventually fail and have to try again.\nFinally, we will offer easy exit access, such as open windows or possibilities of falling into floating corridors, which do not force the visitor to return to the entrance to leave the building at the moment he/she wishes to do so.\n\n\n***Use of Funds***\n\n\n**The grant will be used to pay part of the development costs of Espacio Creador hub in  LAND [\"-61,45\",\"-61,46\",\"-62,45\"]** in accordance with the previous requirements and **prepare multiple activation event for Espacio Creador both in the virtual and in the real world**. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to **attract more traffic to Decentralad and foster the adoption of the metaverse**. This will be achieved through the continuous promotion of Decentraland and all its features across the series of events organised by Espacio Creador, over our webpage (https://escreador.wtf/) and social networks. Each art activation will be done with the purpose of co-creating a wearable collection between all the artists involved in it which will allow multiple artists, designers and boutiques to impersonate their brands in the metaverse and increase the adoption of Decentraland"},"discourse_topic_id":14899,"scores_total":4513890.94396763,"votes":39,"manaVP":250753.040626126,"landVP":2350000,"namesVP":10900,"delegatedVP":1902237.9033415033,"vesting_addresses":["0xB72a5Bf82230EF030D6185CBd0fF970a9Ff78F1C"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"e6c1c3c8-003b-4ecc-958b-de040291aa18","size":12000,"beneficiary":"0xdEF79f2b0e466260B1E87264d327d03De0EAc50c","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":5,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":1,"update_status":"late","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-03-22T13:46:59.602Z","pending_updates":1,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0xb72a5bf82230ef030d6185cbd0ff970a9ff78f1c","vesting_released":12000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-09-21T01:58:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-03-20T01:58:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":12000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.964285714285714}]},{"id":"c7b01920-2e0e-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8","snapshot_id":"bafkreia5gabqzk34brcqw34wktdhmdjyezzj75n3w3cpjr3zcldlnwk6z4","user":"0xd6e62a97a55537cd04847bb73e22208bd20106aa","type":"grant","title":"DCL Virtual Library - Gamifying Education","start_at":"2022-09-06T18:07:00.298Z","finish_at":"2022-09-20T18:07:00.296Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":59600,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"DCLCurations@gmail.com","title":"DCL Virtual Library - Gamifying Education","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"**Month 1 –**\n\n•\tComplete Library expansion design plans\n\n•\tComplete graphic design and modeling for Library Card\n\n•\tComplete graphic design for Book Blaster 5000\n\n•\tDraft graphic design for wearable collection\n\n•\tDevelop backend architecture plans\n\n**Month 2 –**\n\n•\tComplete 3D modeling for Library expansion\n\n•\tComplete 3D modeling and animation of Book Blaster\n\n•\tComplete Virtual Course animation and integration with Library Card\n\n•\tBegin 3D modeling of Library quest materials and code for spawns\n\n**Month 3 –**\n\n•\tRelease process for open Course Submissions from the community\n\n•\tComplete gamification of Book Blaster 5000 quest\n\n•\tComplete 3D modeling of materials and test spawn code\n\n•\tComplete coding for Book repair quest\n\n•\tComplete wearable modeling and submit to DCL for review\n\n**Month 4 –**\n\n•\tRelease wearable line (Tiers 1-3) and integrate into Library\n\n•\tDeploy expanded Library functioning with custom UI, 2 available questlines, 2 NPCs, and an initial set of Virtual Courses\n\n•\tDesign DCL questline format and integration\n\n•\tTest all functionality and stress test new scene\n\n•\tHost release event in DCL","abstract":"DCL Curations has been developing educational material, hosting community events and promoting Decentraland since 2020.

While the course material is currently focused on DCL, we plan to accept all kinds of courses in the future to include other material.\n\n**Needs / goals that will be satisfied:**\n\n• Decentraland is growing rapidly and every experience has different components and requirements to participate (tokens used, social medias to engage with, event schedules, game mechanics, etc.). For example:\n\n     o DG has multiple currencies on multiple chains and participating in $ICE Poker requires specific wearables, staking, activations, delegation and more\n\n     o The Decentraland Report uses Xpand as their social media platform, has tokenized music NFTs, $REPORT tokens, and more\n\n     o This results in a high barrier to entry for most individuals as it requires learning about completely new concepts and items for every experience they want to participate in\n\n• Developing high-quality onboarding videos is very time consuming and often takes a backseat to the continued development work of DCL experiences\n\n**This grant will fund:** \n\n• The creation of educational onboarding videos for groups across Decentraland\n\n• Creation of gamified educational experiences in the CurationStation with future plans for gamification across Decentraland that encourage users to learn and explore what DCL has to offer\n\n• And will foster growth within DCL communities by breaking down complex ecosystems in easily digestible ways to onboard users\n \n**Description of feature / content:**\n\n• The current Library floor plan will be expanded and include new functionality (e.g. moveable ladders, integrated virtual courses, NPCs, item spawn points, and games) \n\n• Talking to the Librarian, users can complete an initial quest to receive a Library Card which gives users access to an introductory set of courses\n\n• Users can then complete additional quests to receive Library Credits and access additional virtual courses \n\n• Initially, courses (~1-5min) will be created by DCL Curations in partnership with the organization that the course covers – at no cost to the organization – and includes:\n\n     o Script development and review with group\n\n     o Audio recording\n\n     o Visual recording\n\n     o Video editing\n\n     o Final review and edits\n\n     o Course upload / Hosting in Library\n\n• Later, courses will also be able to be submitted to the team for review to ensure content accuracy.

BPF's goal is to boost the community in DCL while giving players a reason to be active. The game allows players, AKA farmers, to harvest crops, collect resources and be rewarded with wearables for their accomplishments. With minimal learning curve, farmers found a reason to log in daily and continue harvesting their crops, making it a daily, social affair for DCL players. Furthermore, BPF continues to host events monthly, rewarding farmers for participating and ascending the leaderboard.\n\nInitially started as a pet project by a single developer, the team quickly expanded into a team of 5 due to high traction and interest from the community. As we progressively improved the game features and mechanics, it requires dedication from the team to ideate and solve complex and challenging problems. The team extensively did pro-bono work for all wearables, events, development, server cost, 3D modelling and design efforts. Therefore, we seek funding from the community, as it would be difficult to continue self-funding and dedicating ourselves to BPF, without the necessary support we hoped for in our expansion plan.

Many of the features proposed by the community can be achieved including outfit saving, sorting and filtering, previewing multiple marketplace wearables at once and more.\n\nWhy not create this as an addition to the current backpack?  My main concern when designing this was that any additions to the current backpack would still run into existing issues with the backpack loading slow and not loading in high traffic scenes and at seemingly random times.  \n\nThe goal of this project is twofold: add additional features but also ease some frustration with the existing backpack reliability. I also like the idea that someone looking to build a new client can potentially leverage the closet app for their backpack functionality instead of building their own and can focus on the core client functionality.  In addition, the majority of the new features require some external service to be built, to save outfits etc., which can be integrated faster and easier into the current backpack after they are built.","specification":"The project will consist of a single “front-end” web application, created using next.js, and a server application and database to store outfits and any user related content. Additionally, existing decentraland foundation services (lambdas + catalyst apis) are used to fetch avatar and wearable data.  \n\nThe services will most likely be hosted in AWS, but I will explore other options that can reduce costs so this can be hosted long term.  The final product will have any necessary production-ready features such as data security and encryption, potential use of CDN if loading times are an issue outside of the US, and potentially at least 2 server applications running for failover/redundancy if the need arises.\n\nThe first phase of the project will be focused on the main UI/UX features and the second phase includes integration with the catalyst endpoints to sync outfit changes in game.  In addition to the core features, I hope to add social features, such as seeing other people’s closets and being able to try on other’s saved outfits. \n\nThe goal is to increase user activity and socialization around wearable collections and stimulate more traffic to the marketplace by providing easy navigation for any items they are seeing.\n\nAfter completion, the project source code will be made public so everyone can benefit from the catalyst api avatar interactions, in an attempt to create an ecosystem of many clients, as well as examples of interacting with the dcl lambdas and nft apis.\n\nI have hosted an initial version to demonstrate feasibility, explore the data available and show the basic trying on features: [DCL Closet Prototype](https://dcl-closet.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)  \n\nTo use the app, paste in your wallet address under \"Avatar Address\" and your current avatar and backpack will load.

If you think about watching a video, sound is 50% of the experience (in my opinion it can be even up to 69% of the experience)! The same I think can be said for games and in interactive virtual world experiences (like Decentraland).\n\nI propose to create a series of sound clips that anyone building in Decentraland can use for absolutely free on their parcel (with a copyright notice/license agreement stating that these sound clips may only be used within Decentraland).\n\nMany games within Decentraland could freely use these music compositions or ambience tracks to help with that sonic void in their build. For example, games such as: Wondermine, Exodus, Butterfly Prawn, Golfcraft and more if they don’t yet have any music.\nSome of the plazas seem to be lacking sound including: Forest Plaza, Vegas Plaza and Medieval Plaza. These places feel rather dead to me when entering as there is nothing much to be heard.\n\nThe music as you enter Decentraland in Genesis Plaza is a great example of a parcel that effectively includes sound/music.\nSome other plazas like Soho Plaza, Asian Plaza and Gamer Plaza include background soundscapes which help immerse the player in the build.","specification":"Scope of delivery:\n6 to 9 field recordings for natural ambient tracks (captured on pro location audio recording equipment)\n6 to 9 music compositions of various styles (composed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\n6 to 9 electronic/synth ambient tracks (sound designed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\nA small collection of sound effects/foley for basic object interactions (doors opening and chests opening etc)\nThe plan will be to host these audio clips on a basic website/hosting service which I will set up myself with help from other community members who have offered me assistance.\nOne idea might be to create an “npm package”, have the audio files selectable by the owner/operator who can then stream the audio files to their build with just using some code in the SDK.\nI will likely host the audio clips as ogg vorbis as this is a great codec for high quality in a small file size format. However I will consult builders in the community to help me decide on optimization of the files for playback in Decentraland builds so things work smoothly.\n\nThese will all be freely available for anyone to use in Decentraland. If anyone wants something unique to their own build then they can hire me (or someone else) of their own accord to create something for them.

We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.\n\nAnd YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland. \nWe will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.\n\nThis is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.\n\nWith this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.\n\nDCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.\n\nA short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying” and “renting land” services.\n\nWe’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale. We will appoint a board to adjust our own rate and commission, so it's fair and affordable.

With your support, we can provide the “remote” you need to drive content at scale with no limits, no buffering, and no jitter.\n\nWe need a Decentraland-first streaming platform that enables any streaming need, and one that can grow with our community.","category":"Platform Contributor","personnel":"In addition to the below personnel, we plan to further engage with the Decentraland and blockchain talent pool for certain development aspects around our proposed solution.\n\n-   **Jusdem**  – Tech lead and product visionary\n-   **Paul K.**  – 12x Microsoft cloud MVP and cybersecurity guru\n-   **Prabh T.**  – Cloud services and operations expert\n-   **Aaron H.**  – Business and community development expert\n-   **Patmacs**  – Decentraland dev ninja and DCL Connect founder\n-   **???**  – UI/UX developer\n-   **???**  – Blockchain developer\n-   **???**  – Cloud DevOps and automation engineer","beneficiary":"0xBb626c562D5b89961Eb2a2519e49d97D132189F7","description":"Streaming limitless events with the best user experience requires global CDN networks with a massive amount of bandwidth that can scale in real-time; something most of us just don’t have access to. The answer is simply to harness the power of the cloud, efficiently and securely.\n\nWith a combined 30+ years of experience in cloud consulting with some of the largest fortune 500 companies through infrastructure, development, automation, and cybersecurity. Not to mention we’re a strong player within the community – Serraform is uniquely positioned to deliver a self-service video streaming platform for Decentraland that is fully-automated and simple to use.\n\nWith your support, we plan to further invest in the development of a streaming platform hosted in the cloud and secured with state-of-the-art cybersecurity and compliant solutions. To do this we need to take what we’ve learned and built so far and automate its ability to service you at a moment’s notice. We need the service to scale beyond what our team can manage and let anybody use it themselves when they want, while reducing overall running costs for the community.\n\nWe need to develop an interface and an API that can be used for any parcel owner to leverage the power of our streaming platform, allowing the ability for users to upload any audio/video file for streaming, or copy/paste in a Twitch/YouTube stream URL for those who prefer that route. We also know the community wants to broadcast Zoom podcasts or OBS streams directly into Decentraland but lack the ability to do it at scale and without jitter – we've been servicing all these use-cases, and now we need to package it up in a simple to use service for anybody to use on their own time. Simply upload your video, paste your link, or request a RTMP URL/key and let the fully automated service handle the rest.\n\nIf you’re a developer you might build an interface inside Decentraland or within your own tool if you prefer not to use ours, then leverage our API to deliver on the streaming magic for you. Rent out your venue and allow guests to control their content natively inside your own parcel. Have a club night where your VIP guests control the stream via Twitch or a jukebox collection of content over a stream deck you built! The possibilities will be endless, and this is just the beginning.\n\n**Feature highlights PowerPoint:** https://tinyurl.com/5b58ccx9","specification":"We plan to develop this solution on Microsoft Azure cloud using fully automated code to provision isolated streaming “tenants” using modern DevOps practices. We believe the solution should be cloud-native and have no single points of failure or need for manual intervention, while being able to deliver on your security and compliance needs with maximum horsepower and optimum user experience across the globe.\n\nIn addition to our proposed website UI, we plan to develop an API ‘under the hood’ to allow 3rd party app integration, allowing anybody to integrate their own parcel and control preferences with our streaming solution, either in-game or through 3rd party tooling or websites. **Why not build your own jukebox collection and let party-goers control your screens within your parcel? Imagine building a stream deck inside your venue!**\n\nThe content will be encoded with H.264 studio-grade quality up to 1080p, optimized for Decentraland events, and securely stored using Microsoft’s award-winning Defender security toolset. The streams will be provided as adaptive M3U8 streams, meaning various bitrates and resolutions will be available, accommodating any bandwidth limitations – this basically means **you get a buffer-free experience on every stream at the best quality possible anywhere and on any device**.\n\nThe service will support ingestion of any external stream (via OBS or Zoom for example) using an RTMP URL/key pair, but also **be able to broadcast streams directly from Twitch and/or YouTube** if you already have a URL.\n\nWe plan to leverage Verizon’s global premium CDN network allowing for dedicated content delivery to anybody around the world at very low latency and zero buffering. We want to be able to ingest any video source, and re-broadcast it directly into Decentraland, providing a **great viewing experience for over 1700+ user events.

Often the first question asked of teams looking to build or sell in Decentraland focuses on the metaverse itself and not the team’s use case; although Decentraland is the most decentralized metaverse it still exists in a competitive landscape. Investors and clients often need to justify investment or choice of metaverse before they can start to focus on a team’s specific use case.\n \nBy providing data on Daily Active Users, Total User Growth of Decentraland, and traffic by parcel, builders can refer to these open source analytics instead of each team attempting to obtain them by themselves.\n \n**2. \tPrevent undue load on Decentraland Infrastructure**\n \nWhile the data in question is public, everyone cannot query this data for themselves without an adverse impact on Decentraland nodes.\n \nThere has already been discussion in the forums about shutting down external access to player position data due to increased loads felt by Decentraland content server nodes. Too many concurrent requests to these endpoints would have the effect of a DDoS attack which could impact the quality of the service each node can provide.\n \nTherefore instead of a) playing out the Tragedy of the Commons that would occur if everyone collected the data for themselves, b) removing access such that nobody can benefit from this data, or c) allowing the data to be acquired by the highest bidder/private entity – we believe the ecosystem will benefit most from the data collection being done once and everyone sharing in access to that data.\n \n**3. \tPrevent Private Monopolization of the Data**\n \nWe at Atlas CORP have first-hand knowledge of how valuable this data can be to those operating in Decentraland. User position data can be used to determine how many users attended events – critical for event hosts to understand how well their event performed. Daily active user data is crucial to those seeking to invest in the metaverse to help understand returns on investment.\n \nWe believe that no private institution should be able to gate-keep this information from the rest of the community. We at Atlas CORP used to make this information freely available using our own private hosting infrastructure, but we outpaced our capacity requiring a move to more dynamic scaling solutions. This is why we’re here talking about this proposal.\n\n**tl;dr**\n \nThe DAO can provide the Decentraland community a free source of user data via API for up to one year for the cost of $57,300. The existence of this data set will help to grow the builder and entrepreneurial community by providing important metrics needed to win clients and funding, and prevent monopolization by private entities. Atlas CORP is the suitable candidate for this development given an extensive history in Decentraland data collection and analytics.","specification":"**What Data is in Scope?**\n \nThis proposal is only for Decentraland user data as reported by the /comms/islands endpoint on Decentraland Content Servers.\n \nThis proposal does NOT include:\n* Content Server data (e.g. scene files, user profile history)\n* Scene-specific data (e.g. object clicks and interactions)\n* Any personally identifiable information (PII), excluding ETH wallet address\n* User IRL location data\n* Any derived content from a user’s ETH wallet\n \nData will be collected from all active, registered Decentraland Content Servers which at the time of writing includes hephaestus, hela, heimdallr, baldr, loki, dg, odin, unicorn, marvel, and athena.\n \nThis data set can provide a platform for building more sophisticated reports by the DCL developer community. The DAO could also choose to one day monetize access to this data (e.g. when the data is being used directly for profit), as well as augment what data is collected and made available. It is important to note that this proposal is currently limited in scope to the one data set and free access to the community, and that these next steps may be the subject of future proposals.\n  \n**How will this work?**\n \nData will be collected every 20 seconds and piped into a Mongo Atlas cloud database, with a Digital Ocean server set up to provide API access to queries on the data.\n \nAn automated feed will be set up to collect data from an authoritative source of each active DAO node. Collecting data every 20 seconds will result in 3 datapoints a minute; graphs using one-minute granularity will have 3 datapoints on which to aggregate data points per minute. Data collection will be set up redundantly on two or more servers, or on a single load-balanced cluster, to minimize downtime in data collection. This data is expected to grow at 1Gb per day, which may accelerate with the growth of daily active users.\n \nAs the data is natively in JSON, we propose to use Mongo Atlas as the cloud database of choice. The database will also be deployed with multiple nodes to minimize downtime. Mongo provides an easy way to scale for future needs – whether through increasing storage capacity or sharding the deployment for increased API and query load.\n \nTo minimize infrastructure costs, we propose keeping only 3 months of data available for public consumption. A process will be designed to backup, purge, and post/host historical data such that users can perform historical analysis without excessive cost to the DAO.\n \nAn API server will be written to provide simplified API access to the data in the database. These queries may include things like – users per minute (global or per parcel), daily active users (global or per parcel), and unique Decentraland visitors (global or per parcel). The API code can be made open source and hosted on GitLab, but hosted privately on Digital Ocean to prevent unauthorized access to the DAO’s database. Additional access can be granted to additional DAO representatives if deemed appropriate.\n \nAPI access will remain open, although a throttling mechanism will be put in place per IP address to prevent DDoS of the API servers. In addition, query data (e.g. who’s asking for what) could be saved in the database and made available as APIs for complete transparency.\n \nA dashboard will be made available to show recent Decentraland population data and daily active users for the reportable data set."},"discourse_topic_id":13409,"scores_total":3868687.136637649,"votes":75,"manaVP":334591.4333183406,"landVP":268000,"namesVP":114400,"delegatedVP":3151695.7033193093,"vesting_addresses":["0x6141047169e6df0822b47687a1be516b2bd28d29"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"7422a99e-8a25-4625-9b30-ab688de5dade","size":57300,"beneficiary":"0xe64581F067Cfdce58657E3c0F58175e638C30f2B","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":4,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":2,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-01-12T16:46:26.882Z","pending_updates":2,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x6141047169e6df0822b47687a1be516b2bd28d29","vesting_released":57300,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-08-09T21:10:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-02-05T21:10:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":57300,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.870967741935484}]},{"id":"7b6692e0-44d7-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmNVXwNJUjLb4pRA6Qm7uXARVbifuJW7td5bpvjC92wxTr","user":"0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed","type":"grant","title":"Security audit for collections royalties marketplaces","start_at":"2021-11-13T23:14:00.062Z","finish_at":"2021-11-20T23:14:00.062Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":30000,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Security audit for collections royalties marketplaces","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"The roadmap for adding the royalties in the Decentraland Marketplace will be:\n- Audit the smart contracts\n- Deploy them in the Mumbai testnet.\n- Integrate the new smart contracts in the subgraphs & in the UI.\n- Deploy in Polygon.\n- Launch\n\nRelated to the topic for this Grant.

This makes live events infeasible. For example, live video calls or interactive events take 20 seconds to get a response.\n\nThis project introduces new ultra low latency streaming components to the decentraland SDK and builder to support ultra low latency video. Latency will reduce to ~1 second.\n\nThese components will allow scene builders to easily incorporate ultra low latency video in their scenes.\n\n### Background\n\nIn recent years, global investment in technology and infrastructure underlying ultra low latency video streaming has been significant.  Live streaming is set to explode in the coming years with low latency video being a big driver behind new applications in entertainment, gaming, media, education, acedemia.\n\nUltra low latency video streaming typically operates on a sub 1 second delay.\nThis project will integrate this hot, deep technology into the Decentraland platform.\n\n### Competitive Advantage\n\nMetaverses such as Facebook's Meta already have native low-latency video\nand are building a strong portfolio of apps based on this technology. Other\nMetaverses do not yet have low latency video streaming technology.\n\n### Experimental Prototype\n\nA video demonstration of the components I have developed is here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ml7nlTEk3p8\n\nThis video shows a working prototype of an experimental Decentraland SDK component featuring a low latency video stream.\n\nThe video is streaming from North America to a video streaming server in Hong Kong (on Microsoft Azure) and then back to North America and into a Decentraland scene running in the browser.\n\nThe clock times on the right side are the current time whereas the time on the left, in the Decentraland scene, are latent due to the transit time around the planet and the subsequent decoding and rendering of the video.\n\nTotal time is demonstrated to be around 1 second.\n\nA 5 year old laptop with no GPU was used for the test. The video resolution is set to 640x360.\n\nThe experimental prototype includes modifications to the Decentraland Unity Renderer and Kernel and adds a new video component to the SDK.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a virtual future that runs on a 20 second delay.  Use cases that need lower latency might include:\n\n- Any live interaction such as video calls.\n- Live events where people communicate from the virtual world to the real world.\n- Any use cases that include augmentation of the virtual world with a real object (augmented virtuality).\n- Virtual workspaces\n- Virtual learning spaces that requires interaction\n- Remote control of real world devices such as drones. (yikes!)\n- Immersive commerce\n- Gaming applications\n\n### Existing DAO pre-Proposal\n\nAn existing pre-proposal that covers this feature is here, from Tobik#7989. Note however this is a request for a protocol change, the proposed feature would likely be an additional component so that backwards compatibility is maintained:\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","specification":"### High Level Summary\n\nThe project objective is to create a feature to enable scene builders to easily incorporate low latency video into their scenes.

We witnessed multiple potential tenants reaching out to us to learn more about the rental process as our website helped them connect with land owners. However, we also soon learned that Decentraland remains largely inaccessible to the average person looking to advertise, market their products, or celebrate/host events on it.\n\nWhile we were able to make the lands more discoverable through our platform, the process of actually using the land remains much more complicated. Decentraland allows land owners to grant temporary edit permissions to another user for their land (https://docs.decentraland.org/market/land-manager/#give-permissions) but in order for the tenants to work with it, they need to be well-versed with deploying code to build something in DCL. The problem is that in many cases the tenants don’t really need these permissions and just want to connect and work with the land owner on how they plan to use the land. \n\nThink of the following major use cases for example:\n1.  A production company wants to promote their upcoming film on someone’s land, they would like to directly ask the land owner to put up a poster or some other graphic on a particular asset on the land, for instance, a billboard. Or basically, any other company looking to advertise or market their product’s info on someone’s land.\n2. A family wants to celebrate a birthday party or some other similar event in DCL, they want to use an existing parcel/estate without any changes and all they require is the land owner’s help to let them host the event. \n\nNeither of these above cases require the involvement of a smart contract or any sort of transfer of ownership or other permissions, and the whole process can be worked out simply by connecting and communicating with potential tenants. And so, RentParcel will build a platform that will make it extremely simple to connect with land owners for anyone who’s trying to utilize Decentraland but doesn’t have any advanced knowledge of crypto, nfts, or the metaverse.  \n\nHow is this happening currently?\n\nCurrently, if potential customers want to connect with land owners they do it largely through Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media sources, which is mostly unorganized. There are also metaverse real estate agents and advertising firms that act as middlemen or brokers for facilitating ‘rentals’. Our vision is to democratize access to Decentraland land and create a level playing field in terms of opportunities for land owners. By building a peer-to-peer marketplace, we would be able to have a single dedicated space where anyone can connect with DCL land owners, use their land, leave reviews, and just help make the entire process more open, accessible, and transparent.","specification":"RentParcel will streamline the process of using someone’s land - we plan to model our website in the following manner:\n\n1. For land owners: Land owners would go to our website and create a post for their property (wallet integration will not be mandatory) which will also include the price per day for using their land and the availability.  \n\n2. For customers (any person, entity, or organisation) looking to use DCL land for whatever their need is - renting, marketing, events, etc., would then browse through this website and select their property of interest and duration (for which they intend to use the land), and they will then request to communicate directly with the land owner. \n\nThe land owner will then get a notification that someone is interested in their land and it will be up to them to accept/reject the invite to initiate the conversation. Once the details such as price, duration, etc are finalized, RentParcel will let the land owner set a price and duration which would be then sent to the tenant customer to accept. The exact reason for using the land will be something that will be worked out between the two parties.      \n\nIn addition, we will also include features that can be found on popularly existing marketplace like websites such as leaving reviews/ratings both for landlords and customers, searching, filtering on price, land type, size, etc.\n\nWe plan to use the requested funds for the following:\n1. Accelerating the development of the project and creating informational content - we will hire more developers to expedite the completion of the project. We’ll also retain video editors to create educational content for both land owners and tenants on how to go about using space in DCL for hosting events or advertising. \n2. Marketing - We will also retain an experienced and dedicated marketing personnel who would oversee search engine optimisation (SEO), design our online ads strategy, and handle social media engagement to help increase customer traction for the land owners.  \n3. Establishing Partnerships - We are currently focussed more on Decentraland and will work to partner with companies trying to bring experiences or replicating real world events in DCL by persuading them to use our platform so that land owners are benefited."},"discourse_topic_id":13430,"scores_total":2229745.5305238403,"votes":62,"manaVP":115099.76118125247,"landVP":634000,"namesVP":97600,"delegatedVP":1383045.7693425873,"vesting_addresses":["0x5a590260cd53b68f3634e5fbfd5a813aa3584a2c"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"7de24258-7f7f-4fbf-81d6-3b38d2847c66","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0x46c02dE46629a2bAbe7c9ba1D9EBF0804d4f99AA","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-10-31T11:22:56.108Z","pending_updates":0,"vesting":[{"token":"MANA","vesting_address":"0x5a590260cd53b68f3634e5fbfd5a813aa3584a2c","vesting_released":5263,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-08-04T06:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-11-02T06:00:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":5263,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":2.935483870967742}]},{"id":"99986a30-0cb5-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b","snapshot_id":"bafkreieck4ay7lsd26nbu7dlr2yyymy3ttb7bdu6fvc7odueq2vd3j3uiq","user":"0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2b9c4b263","type":"grant","title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","start_at":"2022-07-26T07:36:00.387Z","finish_at":"2022-08-02T07:36:00.386Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":4600,"tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","email":"bay@vueltta.com","title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Build: July- August 2022\n\n40 hours x \n- 3D build in blender \n- creation of artworks for the labyrinth textures \n- graphic design of all presentation materials  \n\n@$50 / hr\n= $3000\n\nOn-site Demonstration/Facilitation: Sept 2022 \n\n16 hours x\n- two artists at NFT Show Europe to set up screens, streams and facilitation\n - two days of demonstrations in the exhibition hall \n- digital facilitation in the live-streamed events \n- 1hr presentation in the main conference\n\n@$50 / hr\n= $1600\n\nTotal: $4600 \n\nAll other costs such as screen hire, curation, time for organisation and liaison with partner DCL venues, organisation of the events, build deployment costs, copywriting and marketing will be covered by Vueltta art collective.\n\nVisitor stats and feedback will be presented to the DAO via Discord & in the October Townhall.","abstract":"Vueltta is an international art collective creating immersive experiences in Decentraland.

Visitors are invited to explore ‘The Tower Labyrinth’ and ‘The Pyramid Labyrinth’, two large-scale installations across two Decentraland locations. Inside each labyrinth, visitors will experience contemporary art in an entirely new way. \n\nFirst coined by researcher Dr. John Rhodes in 2006, ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ describes the states of mind evoked by walking a labyrinth. According to Rhodes, labyrinths create liminal spaces which promote ‘flashes of intuition, insight and openness’. \n\n**Vueltta’s labyrinths seek to bring this liminal experience into the metaverse.**\n\n*‘Labyrinths are an ancient archetype dating back 4,000 years or more.  They evoke metaphor, sacred geometry, spiritual pilgrimage… and community building’* \n— The Labyrinth Society\n\nYou can see more on the design of the installations in [our slide deck here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DUveBN37F0uI5UsIhEbF5zGrc73sSpX0/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Motivation 1: DCL Beyond 'NFTs in Frames'**\n\nAs an art collective, Vueltta’s aim is to use art installation and interactive technologies to explore how shared virtual experience will shape society and identity. As artists, we’re committed to using Decentraland to find new dimensions for contemporary art. \n\nWe believe creative teams like ours can go far beyond ‘NFTs in frames’ to provide immersive experiences - engaging new audiences both with art and with Decentraland. These ‘non-gaming’ experiences have significance for brands, artists and creative agencies evaluating their entry into the metaverse.\n\n**Motivation 2: Engage a wider creative community with DCL**\n\nThe Labyrinth Effect will be presented at [NFT Show Europe](https://nftshoweurope.com/) to some of the most important digital artists working today. These include [Zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan), [Kim Asendorf](https://twitter.com/kimasendorf), [AL Crego](https://twitter.com/ALCrego_), [VNCCII](https://twitter.com/VNCCII_OFFICIAL), [Loackme](https://twitter.com/loackme_) and [Tim Maxwell](https://twitter.com/maxwellinked). It will also be seen by Hide Uehara, Director of business development for [Square Enix](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix), the Japanese conglomerate behind [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy), as well as brands like [EssilorLuxottica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EssilorLuxottica).\n\nThe conference organisers expect at least 900 visitors. The Labyrinth Effect will be live-streamed into the exhibition hall of the event, where Vueltta artists will demonstrate the project and assist new users. We are also confirmed to present the project on a main conference stage. \n\nTo engage the NFT Europe Show audience further we plan several live events over the show dates. These will also be publicised on DCL discords and open to all: \n\n- Guided Labyrinth Walks with Vueltta Artists\n- Labyrinth Flash Mobs\n\nVideo and photography from these events will be shared across social media. The team's previous events gained 250+ visitors/week through social media promotion alone. We expect visitor data to be much higher when combined with our NFT Show Europe presence, and will report all figures back to the DAO.\n\nFilm and photography from The Labyrinth Effect will be used in presentations for future creative industry summits.","specification":"The Labyrinth Effect will be designed and built by Vueltta, then deployed by our land collaborators. \n\nWe have already confirmed our collaborations for the two build locations:\n\n**Indie Village - location for The Tower Labyrinth**\n\nLand collaboration by [Bill Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-burns-86505059/), gallery build by [KJ Walker](https://www.lowpolymodelsworld.com/) \n\n[Indie Village](https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I4zft&position=100%2C30&realm=dg) is a 20-acre master-planned virtual development that aims to become the premier cultural destination of the metaverse.

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period.\n\n20k backend development = 3,3k/month\n\n10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month\n\n5k web development = 800$/month\n\n15k marketing = 2.5k/month\n\n5k  Discord maintenance = 900$/month\n\n5k  Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners.

Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.\nThe long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.\nTo achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.\n\n![Pixel art character concept art](https://d3da1k6uo8tbjf.cloudfront.net/edd84342-f714-11ec-8fd8-b2d1a80aa527?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22PixelArtCharacter%20Presentados.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27PixelArtCharacter%2520Presentados.png&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAS5PME4CT5QW2PJJU%2F20220628%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220628T204139Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c436f20009faf4e0ef686af1913333050cc54a4c078150cb4cc1c27a2f163974&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kM2RhMWs2dW84dGJqZi5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9lZGQ4NDM0Mi1mNzE0LTExZWMtOGZkOC1iMmQxYTgwYWE1Mjc~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_&Signature=qNUO6ENCDRXzJZGNR2al2iXX7u10HSsaaPB0N0mam-l~LmIUByjxSL5cNrViDmxLbAy32rTPJRYXUK44QR51puMUAvkl0C6DOUJGcCVJ7YH7H6nW-6HFxqgbTeuiVW0NESrBzP4i85kJovCeIa0E5dqeGcFndlG0STktmb07DeLANrPY25kcxxPlL7p7E6TwP8dA7ImMaSOL0LeA76Lq6MAwnSOlsPiaSBCIlZwbsHxzNxSjENh1MiyOGnAXKTodCuhSwhk-636A-HCk4PIaHrVplCbEjR6sioO65jYhtYubmwjHIbW36IoqlPCnyk7Z4gZq5BFa63YXvo7etyjREA__&Key-Pair-Id=K2BMZZDBFKKL41)","specification":"In order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.\n\nYou may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.\n\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700_3735892699868507_512428938455866077_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s640x640&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna&oh=00_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA&oe=62C136F0)\n\nThe main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:\n1. An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.\n2. A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).\n3. The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.\n4. A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.\n5. Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.\n\nWith these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.\n\nAs a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.\n\nOut of scope for this prototype:\n\n* Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).\n* Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.\n* Implementing a 2D sample game."},"discourse_topic_id":12787,"scores_total":11164837.65806079,"votes":55,"manaVP":6419701.109633,"landVP":2524000,"namesVP":89400,"delegatedVP":2131736.548427786,"vesting_addresses":["0x9538bF13B7Eb6b6569adE0804e6ad9FA1AcEa9e5"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"2ab5986b-5c8f-45d3-bf84-90db40dc2475","size":60000,"beneficiary":"0xa63A3eeE0101e61f3c970445A237ED04785ad145","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":4,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-05-18T17:12:11.821Z","pending_updates":4,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x9538bf13b7eb6b6569ade0804e6ad9fa1acea9e5","vesting_released":55900.45910493827,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-07-12T21:05:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-01-08T21:05:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":55900.45910493827,"vesting_status":"Revoked","duration_in_months":5.870967741935484}]},{"id":"bbf5b1b0-f576-11ec-b5fc-5178246a05ac","snapshot_id":"QmPd1PSEJGdNMLQGtZxaXq9JA1oDEq4nCRyVGNgwbSfAiC","user":"0x2ebb0e88c6edeaef1d912bee639a9e6acc2ed418","type":"grant","title":"Creating energetic, personalised content & Building project in Decentraland.","start_at":"2022-06-26T17:38:00.003Z","finish_at":"2022-07-10T17:38:00.002Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":10000,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Creating energetic, personalised content & Building project in Decentraland.","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"My first roadmap can be found on:\nhttps://www.irt-market.com/\n\nI still feel the need to include another roadmap once we are deployed.\nOur project\n\nEssential Achievements in this time:\n* I finished the 48 hour; Solidity, Blockchain & Smart contract Course by Patrick Collins & both in Python and Javascript for the sake of this project.\n* I achieved a big DCL following base on Twitter, youtube, Discord & Twitch.\n* I have a seperate following base as a influencer on Tiktok over 300K views & 20K likes which I'm willing to transfer the  whole dedication to DCL content.\n* I learned how to 3D model & animate thanks to dear friend that took the time to teach me.

With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning.

If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.\n\nZero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K \nWhere M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.\nFirst phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.\nSecond phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.\nThen everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.\n\nIf a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.\n\nAfter the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.\n\nNew players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.\n\nIf within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThis project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.\nVoting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.\nWe plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene."},"discourse_topic_id":12756,"scores_total":1239276.195992277,"votes":35,"manaVP":197225.2308128539,"landVP":364000,"namesVP":4400,"delegatedVP":673650.9651794231,"vesting_addresses":["0x2d6f7aab7f262aa953981e2b9de7df01597a3ba9"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"a30f8767-296c-492c-bbae-b008728b8ab8","size":3200,"beneficiary":"0x7dC0c1E2F54b619B423104c77c9783B1716640a5","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 3","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":3,"pending_updates":3,"vesting":[{"token":"MANA","vesting_address":"0x2d6f7aab7f262aa953981e2b9de7df01597a3ba9","vesting_released":4000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-07-04T15:19:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-10-02T15:19:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":4000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":2.933333333333333}]},{"id":"4b6bb7e0-eed8-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d","snapshot_id":"QmcieLr7K8go6y1u5kZYz48r4E72xEZHTYWhEZMCF8a2NW","user":"0x9429f8b66914d603844501fb0c640e9fd7220377","type":"grant","title":"DCL-Edit - Further Development","start_at":"2022-06-18T07:28:00.734Z","finish_at":"2022-07-02T07:28:00.733Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":240000,"tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"DCL-Edit - Further Development","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"### July, August\n* Refactoring - New Architecture\n* establish CI/CD workflow\n* scene importer - import existing scenes from the Decentraland Builder\n* add Mac / Linux support\n\n### September, October\nAdvanced Asset Management:\n* new asset types: textures, materials, scenes (which will allow including existing scenes in another scene)\n* GLTF compatibility\n* live model update\n* sorting and filtering of assets\n* build optimizations\n\nComponent Generalization:\n* having more components available out of the box\ne.g. audio sources, and utility components like trigger boxes\n* component description interface to make custom components available\n\n### November, December\n* Usability / User Interface Improvements\n* interface for loading / organizing backups (history, settings, …)\n* advanced control settings (keyboard shortcuts, mouse settings)\n* improved Gizmo tools\n* testing phase\n\n\nThe first step is a bigger refactoring iteration - the code needs to be cleaned up, and we need a nice CI/CD workflow established for higher development and testing efficiency.\n\nWe'll then port the tool to Mac and Linux before starting with major improvement on the asset management, entity components, and overall usability / productivity.\n\nWe are regularly synchronizing with the Decentraland Devs, e.g. during the weekly dev meetings on Wednesdays, so it might of course happen that other currently undefined features may be prioritized over the listed features when found necessary.","abstract":"This grant proposal is meant to help funding further development of DCL-Edit over the next six months.

The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:\n- Metaverse journalism\n- Media DAOs\n- Decentralized tools for journalists\n- Token Funding\n- Token-gated content\n- Token incentives for collaborators\n\nThe plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics.

Let us know in the comments!\n\n\n### Why this event?\n\nHosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.\n\nSome of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.\n\n### Why the Decentraland DAO?\n\nLet's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.","specification":"The total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**\n\nBudget breakdown\n\n![budget-breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bmPZjUm.png)"},"discourse_topic_id":12474,"scores_total":2155667.5536721386,"votes":57,"manaVP":119223.95466879994,"landVP":344000,"namesVP":165600,"delegatedVP":1526843.5990033387,"vesting_addresses":["0xe9e3731e11058c6a4e815d73aaed8437aa89a7c1"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"1aa6195a-0984-4413-8b43-45ec1806ea3d","size":20000,"beneficiary":"0x0b30f5f1A39C4899f312c9466c516EAC43d71A42","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":3,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-12-27T19:02:25.371Z","pending_updates":3,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0xe9e3731e11058c6a4e815d73aaed8437aa89a7c1","vesting_released":20000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-06-27T13:49:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-12-24T13:49:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":20000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.9}]},{"id":"f8b699c0-e810-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac","snapshot_id":"QmR7Evkmm12yqtWEvxHX4JugxFudCjUy3MpxH5wN5tgHPt","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"grant","title":"Decentraland DAO Facilitation Squad Grant Proposal","start_at":"2022-06-09T16:26:00.148Z","finish_at":"2022-06-23T16:26:00.147Z","required_to_pass":4000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":75000,"tier":"Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Decentraland DAO Facilitation Squad Grant Proposal","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"All Governance Facilitation team members will be responsible for the following items:\n\n- Attending weekly Facilitation Squad team meetings\n- Attending bi-weekly Core Unit meetings\n- Hosting monthly DAO Town Halls.\n- Maintaining regular presence and facilitating engagement in the DAO Discord server\n\nThe **Governance Facilitation Operations** team members will be responsible for the following items:\n- Defining and administering Decentraland DAO’s social media strategy\n- Supporting ongoing publication of the weekly DAO newsletter with the Governance Squad\n- Producing content to increase DAO participation\n- Organizing in-world meet-ups\n\nThe **Governance Facilitation Research & Analytics** team members will be responsible for the following items:\n- Facilitating issue-specific working groups\n- Researching proposal impact and implementation pathways\n- Mediating between conflicting interest groups and stakeholders\n- Publication of bi-weekly governance update\n- Supporting effective and stable governance","abstract":"Create a governance facilitation unit to support operation of the Decentraland DAO.","category":"Community","personnel":"The proposed team of the Governance Facilitation Squad is as follows:\n\n- Governance Facilitation Manager – Matimio, aka Markman [(  Linkedin )](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewmark/): Matimio is a socio-technical engineer and the current DAO Facilitator.

However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.\n\nUnder the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience. \n\n### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest\nThe team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses. \n\n### Continued development of Decentraland VR\nDecentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.\n\nThe team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"### Decentraland Native Quest Support. \n\nThe team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.\n\n\n### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements. \n\nAs mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR."},"discourse_topic_id":11597,"scores_total":11823891.180638947,"votes":60,"manaVP":6286592.511461278,"landVP":4350000,"namesVP":84900,"delegatedVP":1102398.669177669,"vesting_addresses":["0x38033DFc5660CA719b50807644A586D8BCe0F905"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"3e1a6b4c-c440-4ad2-ac39-2ceb0105552b","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x9A739c2e212754c3d8432CB717dC9437e5b3Dfae","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 6","done_updates":4,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":2,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-12-02T22:26:28.618Z","pending_updates":2,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x38033dfc5660ca719b50807644a586d8bce0f905","vesting_released":240000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":240000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.9}]},{"id":"524fb800-d532-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"QmcdwXxK26SSHt5ZLojYqVMrvxzeQg9kRJY1D7VLfhthcP","user":"0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d","type":"grant","title":"DAO Governance Squad 2H2022 Renewal","start_at":"2022-05-16T16:07:00.768Z","finish_at":"2022-05-30T16:07:00.768Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":172000,"tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"DAO Governance Squad 2H2022 Renewal","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Our north star remains the same: **We will continue improving the mechanisms for which the DAO Community engages with the governance process to lower the friction and increase the quality and frequency of contributions to the DAO**.

One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n- **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n- The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n- **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n- **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n- One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n- The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n- **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n- **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    - Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    - Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\nSure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n- We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL. \nSharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n- Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n- All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n- Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n- Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n- Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n- PvC mode improvements.\n- New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n- We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n- Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.","specification":"Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n\n- **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\nWe plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n\n- **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n\n- **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n\n- **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n\n- **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n\n- **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\nAnd combine these games into one unified economy.\nI am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics."},"discourse_topic_id":11100,"scores_total":6732326.869202191,"votes":112,"manaVP":1759776.2080976642,"landVP":680000,"namesVP":88900,"delegatedVP":4203650.661104529,"vesting_addresses":["0X4240C3EEA13548418AEA8EFC52E4C2E1B2D42F84"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"e5518e9f-81d3-4ce1-b0e7-d60562620b0b","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0xb12ba0b2dc9d9811a7e3b1f76b3f8318bcb58f20","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 5","done_updates":1,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":4,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-08-16T07:11:29.612Z","pending_updates":4,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x4240c3eea13548418aea8efc52e4c2e1b2d42f84","vesting_released":120000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":120000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.870967741935484}]},{"id":"7431b280-c69a-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1","snapshot_id":"QmRKVJXgDu61fouW3zf4cbEiAN18JH8CrNK7iLb2HTxjFX","user":"0x37f00ec67d68c2d3c662339c183d37403c36f28e","type":"grant","title":"P2E (Weekly Decentraland Amazing Race) Every Waifumon Wednesday (Attempt 2)","start_at":"2022-04-28T02:25:00.832Z","finish_at":"2022-05-12T02:25:00.832Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":60000,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"P2E (Weekly Decentraland Amazing Race) Every Waifumon Wednesday (Attempt 2)","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Our goal is simple it's to positively benefit all levels of current Decentraland players, content creators, land owners, wearable creators, and everything metaverse as well as continue to grow the community.

Players must spend FUEL to race. Players get an x amount of fuel every 24 hours and also can receive it as a reward/drop.

These cargo crates contain a randomized assortment of resources/materials. These cargo containers can only be opened in the Junkyard. While also in the Junkyard, players can rummage through the scrap piles to gather additional resources/materials. Players will take these materials and resources to the crafting station where they can craft vehicle tokens to redeem at the shop. In addition to redeeming the skins/vehicles with the vehicle tokens, players can also buy more cargo crates as well as temporary game perks.

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations. \n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs. \n\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748","specification":"To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build. \n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in."},"discourse_topic_id":10802,"scores_total":4660203.247268245,"votes":30,"manaVP":57943.75949321816,"landVP":386000,"namesVP":10300,"delegatedVP":4205959.487775026,"vesting_addresses":["0x24cA7f2854c0791C0Db4d731Fdc1aB9d7E1AdF56"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"0bd54b63-ac72-46cc-9ad6-1d7249e7e6db","size":60000,"beneficiary":"0x0b4F599237229f235aE10b1b7dE5b74165CBDbDe","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":1,"late_updates":1,"missed_updates":4,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2022-09-07T21:32:45.895Z","pending_updates":4,"vesting":[{"token":"USDC","vesting_address":"0x24ca7f2854c0791c0db4d731fdc1ab9d7e1adf56","vesting_released":51511.523919,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":51511.523919,"vesting_status":"Revoked","duration_in_months":5.9}]},{"id":"2e207620-ba1d-11ec-8561-b591bf2cf0d0","snapshot_id":"QmYpV9ds1zyiYyKe8BQjdV6BUffbL69MPC7wTvf5EWtU7N","user":"0xa8285418f6165ae80a1b11bdc9ae6911a8d3a6d0","type":"grant","title":"Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation initiative in Decentraland","start_at":"2022-04-12T04:58:00.234Z","finish_at":"2022-04-26T04:58:00.233Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":60000,"tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation initiative in Decentraland","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"This project will take 6 months to develop and can be broken down into monthly deliverables:\n\nMonth 1: Secure glenrose.dcl.eth NAME (and ENS) for the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation and setup design focus group for the development of the gallery and NFTs;\n\nMonth 2: Assist the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation to write and submit a project proposal for the development of the NFT Gallery and submit a POI proposal to the to the Manhattan DAO;\n\nMonth 3: Create the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation building, with the help of the Metaverse Advisory Group, and deploy Glenrose themed wearables for avatars and launch ‘Wear for Cause’;\n\nMonth 4: Patients will start curating the NFTs, with the assistance of the Metaverse Advisory Group, that will be sold in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation’s NFT gallery;\n\nMonth 5: Prepare and launch a marketing campaign and events with POAPs on Decentraland and other social media platforms around the launch of the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation NFT gallery and web presence;\n\nMonth 6: Deploy the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation NFT gallery, with the help of the Metaverse Advisory Group, and all the proceeds collected from the gallery will be donated to the Glenrose foundation","abstract":"The Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital is one of the largest comprehensive tertiary hospitals in Canada, serving patients of all ages who require complex rehabilitation to enable them to participate in living life to the fullest.\n\nThe hospital uses innovative technology, equipment and programs, and is considered one of the premier hospitals for mental health and psychiatric services for children and seniors, as well as cardiac rehabilitation for adults.\n\nThis grant aims to create an additional source of donations for the hospital through NFTs, which will be created by the patients.

Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF\n\nAs mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes\n\n1. We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2. We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1. Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live\nhttps://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\n2. Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.\n\n3. Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare.

For this we will create a strong documentation and tutorial videos. Meanwhile we will still develop new features.\n\n**Stage 3**. By this stage we expect to have a decent amount of monthly events hosted throughout our platform, be it from individual organizers to several districts. The team will keep delivering features and set metrics to track growth. All the statistics gathered will be shared with Decentraland.\n\nPossible upcoming tasks:\n - Develop Secondary Marketplace for safe ticket resale\n - Add POAP integration\n - Develop Smart Item for the Decentraland Builder\n - Accept more wallets on the DApp\n - Accept Fiat/VISA payments on the DApp\n - Prepare code and SDK documentation & tutorials\n - Build Ranking, Favorites, Support, Statistics and Status pages\n\nFanszoid will use agile development practices to ensure a fast implementation of all requirements and the continuous improvement of such features.\n\nAlso, the team will be available every month to host an open meeting with members of the DCL community to talk about upcoming steps.","abstract":"After everyone's feedback we decided to narrow the scope.

It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.\n\nI hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.\n\nWe can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.","specification":"This module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles.

Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.\n\nThe currently planned features are:\n-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.\n-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)\n-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.\n-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.\n-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game."},"discourse_topic_id":8114,"scores_total":1245968.7580467146,"votes":24,"manaVP":370924.794968722,"landVP":162000,"namesVP":76000,"delegatedVP":637043.9630779926,"vesting_addresses":[],"enacting_tx":"0xa05e2de34ef9cee592cd248f4f74d3b45c166880c99724949751a0b5781278ee","project_id":"5cf5feb2-c852-46ad-a14d-0c20cb495f36","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 2","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"903c4130-8936-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"Qmd57abhvcRihGCh5jjrT3gZM99sZmZi9F5HgnY2uZ9Aw1","user":"0xad015f00d380da858c76d736ff0f266608db0d98","type":"grant","title":"Creating content to help users navigate Decentraland","start_at":"2022-02-08T23:26:00.275Z","finish_at":"2022-02-15T23:26:00.270Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":3000,"tier":"Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment","title":"Creating content to help users navigate Decentraland","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Videos will be released every Monday, Thursday and Saturday.","abstract":"My videos focus on getting users onboarded inside of Decentraland.\n\nThe videos range from getting started with metamask, buying land/names, wearables, P2E gaming and much more\n\nThe purpose is to help onboard new users into the DCL ecosystem.","category":"Content Creator","personnel":"I create my videos alone.\n\nI've been creating Youtube content for over 15 years.\nCurrently sitting at 6.7K subscribers","beneficiary":"0xaD015f00D380da858c76D736Ff0F266608dB0D98","description":"My videos covering DCL thus far have reached over 100 thousand users.\n\nI'm currently sitting at 6.7K subscribers that will be alerted each time I upload.","specification":"https://www.youtube.com/c/StinkyScrublet/videos\n\nThe videos created are straight to the point, no lollygagging or begging for subs.\n\nIf the grant is accepted I will produce at least 3 videos a week centered around helpful tips to get people integrated into DCL."},"discourse_topic_id":7790,"scores_total":1057731.425395843,"votes":69,"manaVP":192474.29516184327,"landVP":318000,"namesVP":20500,"delegatedVP":526757.1302339997,"vesting_addresses":[],"enacting_tx":"0xa05e2de34ef9cee592cd248f4f74d3b45c166880c99724949751a0b5781278ee","project_id":"26eb7097-cd9b-436a-91ea-5c1e9835618b","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xaD015f00D380da858c76D736Ff0F266608dB0D98","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 2","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"9811ede0-94eb-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmbvEqaCfcFT6VUKFgxhHGewDHM94fxtKuTNyUCmQDn1tv","user":"0xfad24dd7573986d827bda9c0171d37e19f6a9f94","type":"grant","title":"IRL Events Including Terminals and Decentraland Speakers","start_at":"2022-02-23T21:00:00.118Z","finish_at":"2022-03-02T21:00:00.117Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":5000,"tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"IRL Events Including Terminals and Decentraland Speakers","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Milestone 1: Now - March 11th - Confirming Venues and Speakers\n\nDeliverables to the team will be venue confirmation, invoice production for event venue and arrange travel for confirmed speakers for each event (we are looking to add to our lineup).

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform.

We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.","specification":"Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future.

Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools.

Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\nByldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2. Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.)

The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land).

New users can find some content on YouTube, read through the SDK, and even find a set of snippets that display core use-cases (animations, transactions, etc); but we currently lack a set of larger, accessible projects which can be studied. Land owners also lack an available set of easily installed scene games, which provide valuable content, without purchasing such content through development teams or external sites.\n\nThis development grant seeks to target these two problems by providing a:\n- functional code-base that can be accessed by developers to further their understanding of DCL development\n\n- playable scene preview that can be easily accessed to show new users a small portion of DCL's potential\n\n- functional game that land owners can freely host on their land\n\nThis project is the first in a series I am planning on developing.

Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene. This means a single scene could host several boards at one time, allowing for land owners to create plazas or hubs for users to play at!\n\nWhen completed, the code-base will be publicly hosted on Git so anyone interested can access/download the files. A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want. All rights to the code-base will be waived, pushing it directly into the community's ownership and allowing interested parties to do with it as they please (including hosting on their land/building upon the project/monetizing play)."},"discourse_topic_id":2854,"scores_total":2556974.201124273,"votes":10,"manaVP":2237674.2011242723,"landVP":216000,"namesVP":1300,"delegatedVP":102000,"vesting_addresses":[],"enacting_tx":"0xf493a2ad834443481c00b1dc8232d7d9f5741c6b6b159124cf5fcb878550f463","project_id":"689c850c-fbf8-4e3a-b993-3491867232f8","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 1","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"1dc31860-5955-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174","snapshot_id":"QmRt694rABcrkM2F3f43HEW1cFbEdsAYXh7sSQKfCKfmzz","user":"0x61a1a8d3ab8dd930d71fe028c00be1287108f0ef","type":"grant","title":"Fantasy Music for Fantasy World of Endless Time Spot","start_at":"2021-12-10T01:04:00.806Z","finish_at":"2021-12-17T01:04:00.806Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":3000,"tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Fantasy Music for Fantasy World of Endless Time Spot","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"A month time maximum.","abstract":"Composition and recording with real orchestral players of original fairy-tale/fantasy music as background for the \"Fantasy World of The Endless Time\" Spot.","category":"Content Creator","personnel":"Full supervision over all steps of the project by Alessandro Giovanetto.\nCurrently 2nd year Master's student at the Royal College of Music, London. \n\n8 years of experience working in the field of composition for media/films/tv.","beneficiary":"0x61a1a8d3aB8dD930d71FE028c00BE1287108F0Ef","description":"Music will be featured in game, accompanying the levels of the puzzle. \nThe atmosphere will be enhanced and user will be experiencing the game on another dimension.","specification":"1.

After the initial pioneering work, virtual worlds can be added to the system-of-systems, ever increasing the size of the would-be Metaverse. Several prototypes have already been created integrating disparate systems using IPSME.

Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4. \n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services. \n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.","specification":"The specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966  \n\nAnd a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK&index=1\n\nOver the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\n\nThe integration of Minecraft and Doom.  https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/metaverse-doom3-minecraft-integration/\n\nAnd, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/\n\n\n### IPSME:\n- Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards\n- translations are external to the systems being integrated\n- reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead\n- reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear\n- each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure\n- ability to dynamically query the network for new services"},"discourse_topic_id":2803,"scores_total":4756495.901014857,"votes":22,"manaVP":2719870.2010148563,"landVP":1280000,"namesVP":7500,"delegatedVP":749125.7,"vesting_addresses":["0x0eE7A7219017693C585C0D3801d1DA977D36C54b"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"8c5c1b16-3c1a-418e-8663-80be2492155c","size":48000,"beneficiary":"0x18871A5a5F729b1C1F1Bf62611773cC26b00c317","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0,"vesting":[{"token":"DAI","vesting_address":"0x0ee7a7219017693c585c0d3801d1da977d36c54b","vesting_released":48000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_contract_token_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":48000,"vesting_status":"Finished","duration_in_months":5.966666666666667}]},{"id":"97eeea20-40b8-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"Qmb9ZVaKqSB68hKqwP5EBGWC66fnzR5hoRCZYEyCdsmtv9","user":"0x3fb38cee8d0ba7dcf59403a8c397626dc9c7a13b","type":"grant","title":"Develop a DCL Wearables Market Analysis Tool","start_at":"2021-11-08T17:23:00.882Z","finish_at":"2021-11-15T17:23:00.882Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":5000,"tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","title":"Develop a DCL Wearables Market Analysis Tool","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Development Sprint 1:\n- Locate the data\n- Program the extraction of the data\n- Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form\n- Conduct discovery interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.\n\nDevelopment Sprint 2:\n- Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the primary and secondary sales data\n- Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS\n- Publish git repo with local deployment instructions\n\nProgress updates will be published to the DAO channel in Discord.","abstract":"Atlas Corporation proposes to develop an open source dApp which is used to determine the total amount of primary and secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator. \n\nAt the beginning of September, the DAO voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from secondary wearables sales to the creators of the wearables.

We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won’t be just a  ‘tour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.\nI fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I’d love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.","specification":"Hire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.\nHire Website Designer, Videographer\nEducate introductory tour guides\nAny left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!"},"discourse_topic_id":2389,"scores_total":6178663.908451845,"votes":12,"manaVP":6002663.908451845,"landVP":6000,"namesVP":68000,"delegatedVP":102000,"vesting_addresses":["0x87074d88a6C6F7763f158C617da2e7fc16FA7Ee0"],"enacting_tx":null,"project_id":"1bde033d-5138-4aae-b6d4-ea1199ee219b","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0x78a6C93cE98DBDBD4EC0D1f6Db17DE9a6A4Ae96E","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 3","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"6e28fee0-206c-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"Qmckt8vuKhxHcPYSW4rvWxCSvr34oNQpU6mmYi1mbedD6a","user":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","type":"grant","title":"Decentraland Snap - Become a virtual photographer","start_at":"2021-09-28T14:57:00.839Z","finish_at":"2021-10-05T14:57:00.839Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"size":5000,"tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","title":"Decentraland Snap - Become a virtual photographer","choices":["yes","no"],"roadmap":"Within the next 3 months the team will work on an MVP:\n\n* Setup a dApp to submit photos and videos.\n* Create a snapshot space for content curation.\n* Define a strategy to mint Snaps as NFTs.\n* Prepare for launch (testing, documenting, auditing).\n\nBefore launch, the project will need to secure extra funding to finance program prices for a few months until the marketplace makes enough money.","abstract":"Decentraland Snap is a play-to-earn game that encourages users to become Virtual Photographers.

Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1. City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely “wired“ from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2. Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3. User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","abstract":"### Proposal\n\nAdd more functionality to the toolbox smart item to enable users to make more dynamic scenes\n\nI will list the updates and then provide more detail below\n\n* Add a set of \"Face Player/Item\" and \"Move to Player/Item\"\n* Add \"Follow path\"\n* Improve the  Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) to be able to run 1 move,1 rotate,1 scale concurrently.

In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here [https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.  \nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27  \n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control \nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) \nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.  \n\n##### Scene Add/remove\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here \n\n[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.
