The same I think can be said for games and in interactive virtual world experiences (like Decentraland).\n\nI propose to create a series of sound clips that anyone building in Decentraland can use for absolutely free on their parcel (with a copyright notice/license agreement stating that these sound clips may only be used within Decentraland).\n\nMany games within Decentraland could freely use these music compositions or ambience tracks to help with that sonic void in their build. For example, games such as: Wondermine, Exodus, Butterfly Prawn, Golfcraft and more if they don’t yet have any music.\nSome of the plazas seem to be lacking sound including: Forest Plaza, Vegas Plaza and Medieval Plaza. These places feel rather dead to me when entering as there is nothing much to be heard.\n\nThe music as you enter Decentraland in Genesis Plaza is a great example of a parcel that effectively includes sound/music.\nSome other plazas like Soho Plaza, Asian Plaza and Gamer Plaza include background soundscapes which help immerse the player in the build.","specification":"Scope of delivery:\n6 to 9 field recordings for natural ambient tracks (captured on pro location audio recording equipment)\n6 to 9 music compositions of various styles (composed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\n6 to 9 electronic/synth ambient tracks (sound designed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\nA small collection of sound effects/foley for basic object interactions (doors opening and chests opening etc)\nThe plan will be to host these audio clips on a basic website/hosting service which I will set up myself with help from other community members who have offered me assistance.\nOne idea might be to create an “npm package”, have the audio files selectable by the owner/operator who can then stream the audio files to their build with just using some code in the SDK.\nI will likely host the audio clips as ogg vorbis as this is a great codec for high quality in a small file size format.

However, there are other practices not yet defined in the terms and conditions which have raised concerns. We’d like to open up the discussion and ask the community to make sure we guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury, with your input. \n\n### Some  concerns raised so far include:\n* When it is impossible for us to have real contact with the Grantee during the 30 days after the grant request was approved by the DAO.\n\n* When the Grantee doesn’t make the official update on the proposal page.\n\n* When Grantees are reluctant to interact with the community (no discord participation, no updates, no response in any channel of communication).  \n\n* When the use of the budget and the project have inconsistencies.\n\n* When it’s not clear who is managing the funds. \n\n* When there’s suspicion of a grantee taking advantage of the intellectual property of a third party.\n\n* When the project is not making progress or the deliverables don’t match the allocated budget.\n\n* When fellow community members raise concerns (publicly or privately) of misuse of grant funds or poor ethics.\n\n* When the project is already getting financial support from the Decentraland Foundation. \n\n* When the grantee has not released the funds vested after 2 months the vesting contract was enacted.\n\n### POLL: Decide the best procedure to revoke a grant?\n\n* **Community Decides:**  Present each case with our arguments and recommendations to the Community and ask if the Grant should be revoked.\n\n* **DAO committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations for the DAO Committee to decide if the grant should be revoked.\n\n* **New committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations and assign the responsibility to decide to a NEW Committee which specifically addresses these matters.\n\n* **Do nothing.**\n\nWe’d love to hear your opinion regarding the decision making on these types of concerns.

It's an extended wrapper class around .glbs/gltf that can add additional complexity like jiggle bones, expressions and VR player mapping.\n\n### How\nDecentraland's human skeleton model is an exact match to the VRM-humanoid model, making this process feasible. We would not need to add jiggle bones or expressions, they are optional; The VR player mapping can be done in the .glb -> .vrm conversion thanks to this already matching bone structure. A unity plugin, uniVRM, does this automatically already - we would need to implement this functionality in a pipeline that can automate this process.\n\n### Why\nAn API that can export the .vrm of a player would be incredibly useful, not only for the upcoming VR Client, but also for interoperability with all VR and non-VR games. The .vrm model is easily imported to external games, allowing our avatars to travel 'across the metaverse' without custom implementations and rigging.\n\nThis API should be locked so you can only export your current character, ensuring that you can only bring your current avatar into other games. This process would require an eth sign on API request to ensure the user has ownership, enabling DCL to remain in control of the ownership and creator rights.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, I think this would be a powerful step forward for interoperability as well as avatar/wearable ownership, enabling a 'one-click' button to import DCL characters into other games. I already use my 'morphbot' avatar on both twitch and VRChat thanks to this process, but an automated API would unlock this for all users and developers.\n\nKeen to hear thoughts and would love to hear the VR team's feedback on whether this is being explored currently, the M3 org has also expressed interest in this, as it would enable import of DCL avatars to the webaverse's upcoming MMO.","choices":["Implement an API that can generate, cache, and export a user's current model as .vrm","Do not implement, not useful","Unsure of feasibility to run and maintain","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":14208,"scores_total":2346102.6370631764,"votes":62,"manaVP":184965.15125593892,"landVP":454000,"namesVP":102100,"delegatedVP":1605037.4858072374,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"ed473f50-1cf8-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b","snapshot_id":"bafkreicosjgyhinj6nazcvqhj6tnx74lgdzupwzlmj5ylownbtpan7lsji","user":"0x5b815a4554b45c926dbb3d97470e59302f2bc8f7","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -61,119 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-08-16T00:18:00.669Z","finish_at":"2022-08-23T00:18:00.668Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"active","configuration":{"x":-61,"y":119,"description":"The Petaverse is a place for pet-lovers in Decentraland to meet and play with Pets!\n\nVisitors can play (for free) our care-to-earn game to collect bones & unlock cool pet-themed wearables from Petaverse & other Creators.","type":"add_poi","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":14196,"scores_total":1197488.055580456,"votes":66,"manaVP":38459.16893310108,"landVP":320000,"namesVP":14000,"delegatedVP":825028.8866473543,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"32ab78a0-1cda-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b","snapshot_id":"bafkreifk3pcxjthrmh5c2otxwgaqfmbgvxhgikqvb7nns7ebdt5j6droqu","user":"0xf2f58ed9ab3057838d88d06be8269270cdc8aa89","type":"poll","title":"Prevent harassment and surveillance of all users via overly-exposing endpoint","start_at":"2022-08-15T20:38:00.690Z","finish_at":"2022-08-20T20:38:00.687Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"finished","configuration":{"title":"Prevent harassment and surveillance of all users via overly-exposing endpoint","description":"Hello I am Mendez, and I've been a core contributor of Decentraland since Jan 2018. This is my first governance proposal ever since.\n\nSeveral people have brought this problem to my attention and I acknowledge this as a vulnerability that needs to be addressed before it starts affecting people and their digital lives.\n\nIn Decentraland, users’ addresses represent more than a transaction parameter in a blockchain, they are part of a user’s digital identity, and exposing this information along with real-time position data could lead to a form of digital surveillance that could be damaging to users and to Decentraland itself. \n\nCatalyst communications server exposes an API endpoint that responds with user addresses and their exact locations at every moment, facilitating hostile actors to harass platform users. This API could also enable the creation of hate bots that could target specific users or types of audiences. This type of information should be treated as sensitive to prevent these types of scenarios. The endpoints to be removed are:\n\n- https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/peers\n- https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/islands\n\nThese endpoints are not needed in order for Decentraland to work. In fact, they were originally intended for manual debugging purposes only.\n\nHowever, by removing the endpoints in question, there is also a drawback: this API is used to know if a user is in a specific location at the time of making a request. In some scenes, this feature is used by some anti-bot mechanisms. To that extent, a new API endpoint is proposed to validate if a user is in a specific position on a case-by-case basis instead of tracking all the users all the time. For analytics/statistical information of islands, new privacy-aware endpoints were already created [/stats/parcels](https://peer.decentraland.org/stats/parcels)\n\nSummary of the proposed changes:\n- Remove the `/comms/peers` and `/comms/islands` endpoints.

The district has 279 parcels thanks to MANA donations from 61 contributors. Since then, lack of capital has been a big hurdle for Nexus to deliver on its vision. Efforts to get 3d modelers and programmers to work for free failed. Skilled professionals want to be paid.\n\nRecently, the team commissioned conceptual designs and an urban plan for the district, and the results have been amazing. With grant funds, we can pay talented architects, modelers, and developers to complete and deploy this design.\n\nWe can create a new kind of commerce and entertainment district with cost-effective leasing options for any company or creator who doesn't want to buy land. By lowering the friction to set up a presence in Decentraland we plan to attract new companies and creators, and their followers, who might not come here otherwise.\n\nThe Nexus project is also partnering with [Parcel](https://parcel.so), the premier metaverse land marketplace, creator directory, and education platform, to present leasing opportunities to potential clients, including well-known companies and brands.\n\n**Cohesive Design and Planning**\n\nThe district design unites shops, galleries, anchor presences, a shared event space, and an open market plaza in a cohesive architectural whole. The initial design concept shows that Nexus can become a spectacular addition to Decentraland, attracting new brands, businesses, and players.\n\n![Nexus Crystal City concept](https://wonderzone.io/img/nexus/NexusCrystalConcept.png \"Nexus Crystal City concept\")\n\nThe large front area is a shared event space where events can be run by any Nexus tenant. It can be configured as a stage for concerts, or as a large screen viewing area for films and video streams.\n\nThe expansive corner quadrants are open to larger companies who want to house their HQ or other custom-built structures in Nexus. These are some of the anchors that should attract new attendees to the district, and benefit from the traffic brought in by other nearby tenants.\n\nThe dramatic \"Crystal City\" structure will become the main Nexus landmark. It's also practical. The larger structures can house multiple shops, galleries, and other leasable spaces.\n\nWe want to bring together world-class design and architecture, fun interactivity, real-world retail brands, and the Decentraland creator community. The resulting district and the attention it will garner could help cement Decentraland’s position as the leading metaverse platform, and demonstrate new use cases and experiences for the future.\n\n**Previous Work**\n\nThe team members are well positioned to deliver. They have already deployed a number of impressive builds in Decentraland. \n\n With the WonderZone team, Rob Dixon designed and created the [WonderZone Amusement Park](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-50%2C51) and the ever-popular WonderMine game.\n\nIn addition, [LEDY](https://ledy.io) has already built:\n\n* The [New Scirocco Resort](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-38%2C-105) from their [Extraverse](https://www.extraverse.xyz/) collection. Sold for 42 Eth.\n* The second resort NFT, [Grand Aurelia](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54).\n* The [607 Beverly Hills Metahouse](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a for-sale $9.4M mansion.\n* The [Ferrari 90210 home](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a real-world $17M home.","specification":"This grant will be used to fund four aspects of development:\n \n1. **Refine architectural design, urban planning, and layout.** Starting from the initial concept, we’ll add details regarding urban planning and a unified district map for the district. This will also include design style guidelines for modelers who will create individual structures on the map.\n\n2. **Build and deploy core structures and shared spaces.** This will include the central Crystal City, the plaza and event space, and the paths and common areas between the leasable lands. LEDY works with a network of talented modelers and can source the best ones to deliver the buildings, landscaping, and other elements we need.\n\n3. **Build interactive experiences.** We will pay developers to create unique interactive experiences in the district, so every visit is entertaining. One core experience is the convertible event space that can shift from an open music stage to a covered film theater. Other work involves support for easily setting up and configuring shops, gallery spaces, or marketplace booths for creators.\n\n4. **Brand awareness and public relations.** Building upon branding work being done with Parcel, we will involve a top PR agency to create awareness of Nexus and Decentraland in major media publications. This can attract more companies who are interested in leasing areas within Nexus, and by extension bring new players with them. LEDY’s recent work deploying real estate models in Decentraland to support luxury home sales, amplified by public relations campaigns, got them coverage on TV news and multiple real-world publications.\n\nThis grant alone is not enough to build out the entire district plus all the interactive experiences and commerce infrastructure we envision. We're starting with a relatively small grant so we can show positive results in the first 6 months. Then if there's a need for a future grant we'll have a solid track record of achievement first. Of course, we hope that after 6 months we'll lease many spaces in Nexus, making future grants unnecessary.\n\n**Benefits to the Decentraland Community**\n\nThis project could provide many benefits for the community:\n\n* The leasing model allows those who can’t afford land to set up their own shop, gallery, or other space. It can help **alleviate concerns about land scarcity pricing people out**. Leasable areas within Nexus can be as small as 1x2 parcels, with low leasing rates.\n\n* Our tenants share the common event space. It's more cost-effective for a company to build a Decentraland presence without having to buy extra parcels to build their own arena or theater. This might **attract companies that wouldn't come to Decentraland otherwise**.\n\n* New companies mean **new work for creators who can help them build out their presence**. We are working with Parcel’s Creatorverse program to find creators in the community who want to build out shops, galleries, and other spaces for tenants, and get paid for it.\n\n* **The more tenants in the district, the more everyone benefits**. We plan on a mix of large anchor presences, plus medium-sized and smaller spaces. Like a thriving mall, people might come to see one space, then be intrigued and investigate the whole district, discovering new creators and experiences as they go.\n\n* We want to make it **fun to visit Nexus every day**. We'll use learnings from other projects to build surprises, flexible features, frequent events, and even game-like features to keep things interesting.","personnel":"Decent Amusements LLC manages Nexus and the nearby WonderZone Park, one of the highest traffic areas in Decentraland.\n\nLEDY is a metaverse real estate developer with extensive experience building luxury metaverse content. \n\nParcel is a virtual real estate marketplace, creator directory and education platform uniquely positioned to offer everything people need to make the most of the metaverse.\n\n**Rob Dixon (Radix)**:\nActive in the Decentraland community since 2017.

Allowing a way to book the auditorium is one way we can boost engagement, allow access to the metaverse for different types of industries and also support local twitch streamers. \n\nPrice has been placed to avoid the service being abused but also not so high it’s unobtainable to some users from a global perspective. This is a high traffic location and the more traffic, the higher mana value will become and this will justify a higher price for this streaming location.\n\nThis will allow users without access to land to hold small events, workshops and shows that’s easily accessible and being local to genesis plaza something to find straight away for new users to engage with. This will also allow Decentraland committee members or foundation to host talks or discuss updates that are separate from townhall.\n\nThe system will work as a kind of Juke-Box so it can be completely automattic without the need of a committee or central management. Users can supply a youtube or vimeo link when booking and the video will be added to the queuing system. When no video is laying it will revert back to the default looping video currently playing.\n\nI’m happy to support where I can as a member of the community to have this implemented so momentum isn’t lost! \n\nMOTIVATION\n Decentraland currently has community resources that can be utilized to support the new users or creators without access to land. With the recent increase of land rental it would allow an easy way to run community events and simple revenue stream of mana into the DAO to fund future grants/proposals. \n\nAllowing a booking system to the auditorium will benefit: \n- Film Makers \n- Streamers \n- Podcasts\n- Musicians/DJs\n- Educators\n- Animators\n\nIn the past we’ve seen successful events around movie showings , sports steaming and a need for that shared viewing experience. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nQueued video service set up on the Governance forum with a fee to submit\nNPC deployed (I can design or we can use existing robot NPCs) in the Auditorium that can have basic explanation of bookings and link to the governance forum\nVimeo or Youtube link supplied to avoid any harmful or IP infringement content\nContact details supplied and IP ownership signed by users when booking, so if something like unlicensed music or footage is played the ownership is on the user, and not Decentraland \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis can be a test and learn to explore ways to develop new areas of revenue as part of the Decentraland platform, methods to utilise existing resources (Gamer Plaza, Las Vegas etc) and setting up a space to share with the community. This is also experimenting how much the community can influence the user experience in Decentraland community spaces that get overlooked.\n\nA booking system can potentially expand to other community resources owned by Decentraland or foundation. This will reduce barriers to entry for a wide variety of industries and events like short film festivals, comedy shows, live performances, business presentations etc.","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":14117,"scores_total":936153.5547993089,"votes":39,"manaVP":97678.10298878812,"landVP":54000,"namesVP":6200,"delegatedVP":778275.4518105208,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"5bd7e100-1b0e-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b","snapshot_id":"bafkreighf4wldgjzwizrxgaexc4jpfeas7skq4c5fwviog73eqdtr2k37y","user":"0x598f8af1565003ae7456dac280a18ee826df7a2c","type":"poll","title":"In wearables, allow extended publisher metadata (for games mostly)","start_at":"2022-08-13T13:46:00.272Z","finish_at":"2022-08-18T13:46:00.269Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"finished","configuration":{"title":"In wearables, allow extended publisher metadata (for games mostly)","description":"As some of the wearables in decentraland have utility in games.\nWhat I want to achieve is to show extended metadata for wearables in Decentraland marketplace and Opensea.\nVisual example: https://bafybeierdoahginhssrnhykue3rdjzvdhcq723in6aj7zb7iemyckf6rq4.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\n\nIdeally, would be that publisher sets an endpoint to provide the extended metadata to allow mutability.\n\nBut before defining the technical approach lets see if people likes it.","choices":["YES","NO","Remove vote","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":14109,"scores_total":1766580.8324996624,"votes":39,"manaVP":146834.02911773618,"landVP":348000,"namesVP":91600,"delegatedVP":1180146.8033819264,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"86683470-1969-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b","snapshot_id":"bafkreihwaue2fwwtvmw6g6jemdwvvnau5pdll32shisaow4ebjdmvko52u","user":"0x799b8de35a3c9af656088e2b7f47f6dc9aaa576a","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 35,-96 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-08-11T11:34:00.559Z","finish_at":"2022-08-18T11:34:00.559Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":35,"y":-96,"description":"First branch of bank TatraBanka in metaverse.","type":"add_poi","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":13992,"scores_total":932334.8443243335,"votes":51,"manaVP":8087.814904870367,"landVP":52000,"namesVP":4100,"delegatedVP":868147.0294194631,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"0c233e00-18ef-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b","snapshot_id":"bafkreiduxzkv2b5i23fxpw5pslywmiy6ieuppsq3ddc54d7r3s4rjsm3re","user":"0x29519122d08771ca4c83c8e3fa981df18721f76d","type":"grant","title":"[Resubmission] Easy Land Renting - Lands for everyone!

Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.\n\nAnd YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland. \nWe will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.\n\nThis is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.\n\nWith this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.\n\nDCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.\n\nA short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying” and “renting land” services.\n\nWe’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale. We will appoint a board to adjust our own rate and commission, so it's fair and affordable. (Cheaper than today) Most likely 2,5% to 10% to the realtor platform.","specification":"Blockchain: Ethereum\n\nTools:\nvscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract\nReact, redux, tailwind for website\nReact, redux, react native for app\n\nIssue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space. This results in lower trust in Decentraland, and therefore less community usage and interaction. It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.\n\nSolution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed.

It is not possible to make sure they can't, so this is a fully secure rental-system which will provide security for the tenant's funds, and landlord's land asset. This is why this project DO NOT transfer any land-nft-asset but simply acts as a money-middleman, and takes a fee for doing it automatic, easy and cheap. If a landlord/landowner proceed to remove operator/sell the land after renting it out, the tenant will be refunded, and the land-owners' address will be noticed as a \"Bad Landlord\".\n\nDAO will get income from the sales and rentals, aswell as the landlord and realtor platform fee's.\n\nPayments and commissions to DAO will be sent to:\nEither DAO directly: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce\n\nOr Multisig owned by the DAO Committee (Yemel and HPrivakos): https://etherscan.io/address/0x89214c8Ca9A49E60a3bfa8e00544F384C93719b1\n\nWe will make the smart-contract and address changeable, because DAO is still new and it's growing fast so we might need to change in the future, after advise from DAO committee members.","personnel":"THE TEAM:\nLead Developer & Blockchain Developer:\n\nAaron Porchia (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-porchia-054a96239/)\nWeb3 Development Manager:\n\nTravis Holm (T-rav#0132 on discord)\nCo-Founder & CEO of DCL Real Estate:\n\nEmil Klockmann (Klockmann#3349 on discord)\nRental Agent, Co-Founder & DCL Expert:\n\nChristoffer Laursen (Laursen#4812 on discord)\n__________\nDEV-TEAM RESULTS AND BACKGROUN:\n\nETH projects:\nOxygen token\nStrip token\nleaf token\nball token\nDefiPlaza token\n\nMessaging app on ETH:\nhttps://www.epigeon.org/\n\nNFT Marketplaces:\nhttps://portion.io/\nhttps://www.nftation.io/\n\nNFT Collections:\nhttps://themetakey.com/\nhttps://mooncat.community/\nhttps://nbayc.co/\n\nExchanges:\nhttps://defiplaza.net/\nBinance\n\nPET NFT and staking rewards:\nhttps://pets.micropets.io/\n\nSocial media platform in solana:\nhttps://satellite.one/\n\nTrading platform:\nhttps://www.orca.so/\n___________________\n\nSite:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EojSz4K.png\nwww.DclRealEstate.org\n\nBudget:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0o7AvJL\n\nLinks:\nWebsite: https://dclrealestate.org/\n\nEmail: dclrealestateagency@gmail.com\n\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP\n\nOffice in DCL: https://dclrealestate.dcl.eth/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DCL_RealEstate\n\nArticle about us: https://medium.com/@hugh.blaxland/newcomers-dcl-real-estate-driving-development-in-decentraland-1da112c1d210\n\n\nFor any further questions we are ready to answer any questions you might have.","roadmap":"This project will be completed within 6 weeks-6months. \n\nAnd the roadmap is as follows:\n\nMonth 1-3: Development of the FUTURE of Rental platform.

Keeping the RTMP server funded is crucial for the onboarding of new musicians, artists, and DJs by allowing Sinful to provide them a stage on which to perform.\n\nPreliminary work Beyond The NFT: Average 30 viewers on twitch and 40-50 users on parcel \nhttps://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=c66eb4bb-9035-4f12-95dc-74ed4a62a93f\n\nDecentraland Community Building Twitter Space: Average 20 viewers on Twitch, 35+ listeners on Twitter, and 15+ people on parcel \nhttps://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=ddcf355b-6fd6-41b5-9f0c-46a3d7f824a5 \n\nFund Allocation for 1 year: \nRTMP funding: $5500 \nHardware costs: $5000\nSoftware/services: $1000\nTravel: $5000 \nSalary: $43,500 (approx. $20/hour at 40 hours/week)\n\nAverage annual salary for Community Relations Managers in his area is $99,000 as of July 26, 2022, but the range typically falls between $82,150 and $119,916.

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players and thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Original proposal ###\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-bafkrei-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland/13138\n\n### TL;DR changes in resubmission ###\n- Renting land for a reduced price through [@dax](https://governance.decentraland.org/balance/?address=0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5)\n- Updated budget focused towards achieving a concrete six month Roadmap\n- More details re: past team experiences in game and software development\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an\nordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience\n\n### Scope ###\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of March\n2023. In that time our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have,\nby the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all\nDecentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics ###\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to\nDecentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n- A session in D&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n- An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n- Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating one themselves.","specification":"### How we see the final result: ###\n\n1. Each player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters.\n2. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\nin the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3. The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\nreceive a task from a non-player character in the story.\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a\ntavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Approach the tavern and start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nSome actions’ success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, to \"Sneak\nattack the guard\" you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is a 10; you roll the dice, if you roll a ten or lower you miss, greater than 10 and you hit.\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game\nends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another\ncharacter, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be\ncompletely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n\n\n\n### Budget Breakdown ###\n\n___Total: 60k___\n\n___Team Salaries: 49k___ \n- _15k SDK Dev_\n- _15k 3D Artists_\n- _8k  Game Designer_\n- _4k  Game Master_\n- _4k  2D Artist_\n- _3k  Sound Designer_\n\n___Marketing: 6k___\n\n___Servers and infrastructure: 3k___\n\n___Land Rental for 6 months: 2k___\n\n### Tech Stack ###\n\nMuch of the game will be built using the Decentraland SDK but part of the infrastructure will be external. For this we will use a custom built backend server to store player scores, preferences, gaming history, and more. \n\n### Revenue plan / Sustainability ###\n\nWhile we do plan to create some wearables and possibly make some purchases available, adding a large number of profit-making functions will greatly burden the project, and making a profit is not our goal.","personnel":"### Core team ###\n\n__Soulsinger__ - manager of the CEN studio; game designer;\nthe ideological inspirer of the project\n\n__Dax__ - SDK Developer\nIn Decentraland since 2017; \n10 years of software development experience; \nwinner of the 2022 DCL Game Jam\n\n__Casuallvl__ & __Orina__ - 3d artists. \nSpecialists in 3D modelling of low-poly objects\n\n__Master Eador__ - Gamemaster.\nLongtime TTRPG player;\n2 years experience as a professional gamemaster\n\n__Mia__ - 2d artist. \nArt student with experience in building game assets\n\n__Alexander__ - Sound designer. \nKnown in some circles as ‘The Man with Three Ears’\n\n### Relevant experience ###\n\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years.

This means that for every $1000 worth of MANA collateral a $430 loan can be taken. \nThe current borrowing interest is 2.34%/year, but the rate is currently floating(*).\nThe borrowing limit for MANA on Fringe Finance is currently $10,695,406.\n\n**Steps:**\n\nDeposit sufficient MANA token collateral on the Fringe Finance platform from the treasury.\nThe corresponding USD-denominated line of credit is issued.\nUp to $10,695,406 USDC loan can be taken and used by the Decentraland DAO.\nAnnounce the taken loan on social media and official blog. If the loan will not take place announce the additional utility of the Fringe Finance integration for the community.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nReduced selling pressure on the market\nSignals the additional utility to MANA holders in that they can access stablecoin loans\nFund DAO operation by locking MANA tokens and increasing cash flow \n\n**About Fringe Finance:**\n\nWe‘re partners with projects such as Polygon, Chainlink, REN, Elrond, Bancor, IoTeX, Lido, and others.\n\nFringe Finance has twice been audited by respected [firms](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf).\n\nOn Fringe, borrowers deposit collateral against which they may take out loans in a select set of the most liquid and reliable USD stablecoins. The resultant benefit for borrowers on Fringe Finance is that they have access to deep, unfragmented capital pools from which to borrow. This significantly reduces both the interest rate slippage they can expect when taking out a loan, in addition to reducing interest rate volatility over the course of their loan.\n\nFringe’s depth and concentration of lending capital liquidity also benefit lenders, as it similarly reduces the interest rate slippage they can expect to experience when depositing capital as well as reducing fluctuations in the interest paid on their capital. This indirectly benefits borrowers, as lending on Fringe becomes more attractive, resulting in more capital being available at lower interest rates. \n\nAn additional indirect benefit for borrowers is that Fringe’s platform employs empirically sound custom algorithms to determine lending parameters so as to maximize platform stability. This attracts lenders to the platform and therefore results in greater capital available for borrowers.","choices":["Support funding $MANA community operations on Fringe Finance’s Primary Lending Platform","Do not support","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":13662,"scores_total":795407.1832195949,"votes":49,"manaVP":10154.981550167517,"landVP":38000,"namesVP":15100,"delegatedVP":732152.2016694273,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"51724740-1362-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8","snapshot_id":"bafkreidomkpggbkla26ooss5rai5v54tfvshycdhmbyvgjox2pzk4fwge4","user":"0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d","type":"governance","title":"POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect","start_at":"2022-08-03T19:27:00.252Z","finish_at":"2022-08-17T19:27:00.250Z","required_to_pass":6000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"d43ed210-fd5f-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a","title":"POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect","summary":"Update the current POI management mechanism by removing the centralized list and unifying it with the decentralized DAO-maintained list, migrate that list to Polygon (cost reduction) and outside of Aragon (Better UX)","abstract":"This proposal aims to solve the existing complexity created by having two POI lists, [one centralized under the Decentraland Foundation](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) and the other maintained by the DAO using an Aragon smart contract. The proposed solution encompasses: Deleting the Legacy POI list, and moving the DAO-maintained POI list from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon and outside of the Aragon infrastructure in order to reduce the costs and enhance the experience of adding and removing POIs. Finally, the DAO core teams will encourage the community to create proposals under the Add POI category in the Decentraland DAO Governance dApp to add the POIs that are still considered relevant.","motivation":"As the project keeps moving towards an even more decentralized future, having a list that cannot be modified by the community or having two lists that community developers need to take into consideration when building products for the Decentraland ecosystem is a weak spot. Especially if that list contains such essential places in the Decentraland world as Genesis Plaza, the Decentraland Museum, or the Crypto Valley.\n\nAlso, moving the DAO-maintained list away from the Ethereum mainnet and Aragon infrastructure into Polygon will reduce operational costs (Currently adding/removing POIs cost ~200USD in gas fees) and make the process for the DAO Committee easier, as using Aragon to send transactions is not ideal UX-wise.","specification":"Below is a proposed list of milestones:\n\n-Launch a communication campaign regarding this change and encourage Decentraland users to submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)\n\n-Once that period ends, the DAO Committee will engage with the Decentralad Foundation teams to orchestrate how the change will be done. This will be communicated to the Decentraland community via Discord and the Forum.\n\n-The actions to be orchestrated will be: Delete the Legacy POI list, enact the addition of the new POIs on the DAO-maintained list by the DAO Committee (Ideally those two actions should happen synchronously), and migrate the DAO-maintained list to Polygon.\n\n-Communicate to the community the result of these actions.","impacts":"**Best case scenario**\nThe community submitted all the relevant POIs to be approved in time and no actually relevant POI is forgotten or missing.  The merge and migration go completely as expected, there is no gap between honoring the hardcoded list and the DAO-maintained one resulting in total availability of the POIs appearing on the minimap. Polygon migration is performed successfully.\n\n**Worst case scenario**\nThe community does not engage in the process of the POI proposal creation, some important POIs are forgotten resulting for example in a relevant parcel no longer appearing as a POI on the minimap. The merge gets complicated resulting in a gap where we are not honoring the hardcoded list anymore but the smart contract is not updated yet. Polygon migration fails.","implementation_pathways":"**Unifying POI lists**\n\n- Communication campaign notifying the community that this initiative has passed and that from now on they can submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)\n- Once the period ended, stop honoring the Foundation maintained POI list and enact all the approved POIs to the Smart Contract (Mainnet)\n- Move to the second milestone (Polygon Migration)\n\n**Migrating POI Smart Contract to Polygon**\n\n- Deploy POIs contract in polygon owned by an EOA \n- Migrate all the existing POIs with a script to the new POIs polygon smart contract \n- Transfer the ownership to the DAO committee multisig\n- Deploy a POIs subgraph in Polygon so the Decentraland Foundation Catalyst team can start using it. \n- Notify the Decentraland Foundation Platform team about this change","conclusion":"By doing this we keep empowering Decentraland users to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and reducing the costs of adding and removing POIs. As the Decentraland community and the activity grows, being cost-effective and quick regarding these changes will lead to a better experience for the users.

In the 5 weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Scavenger Hunting, and nearly completed preparations for the next gaming objective - Mining. Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Workshopping, Forging, Cooking, and Hunting. During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.\n\nWe plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion. We aim to deliver minor bug fixes, quality of life updates, and patches on a weekly to biweekly basis. Please view our video that walks you through the beginning stages of our game: Exodus is in an open beta and will continue to further stress test the game’s infrastructure and prepare for public release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdsrU_Mz9no \n\nWe use a variety of technologies for software development, design, server maintenance, and project organization.

This economy data can feed in to the AI to provide the highest-quality classifications of users for the entire gaming industry to empower LiveOps campaigns, advertising & marketing, increasing Ad Delivery revenue generation, and so much more.\n\nAs a result, we have the best AI platform on the market to:\n\nEnrich any data, (1st, 2nd, or 3rd party data),\nClassify and categorise data and contextual behaviours at scale,\nFeed creators' own data back to them to further optimise their experiences for more engagement and retention.\n\n\nAND TOGETHER\n\nBy combining Engine's ability to manage economic instances with Thunderstruck's ability to turn those economic instances into actionable insights, which can in turn be used to further optimise economic instances to maximise player retention and engagement in terms of both time and money spent in play and platform, we can help Decentraland, and its creators to design and run more fun, and more profitable metaverse expenses to convert intrinsic value into shared extrinsic value and virtuous cycles for all parties.","specification":"Thunderstruck version 1 is already live.\n\nEngine version 1 launches on the 1st of September 2022.\n\nSee our product demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/8152f63ee96846ebaa508fd65fffeba2\n\nEngine product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/The-Economy-Engine-b6e3b6ca58a14669a8d420acc1727650\n\nThunderstruck product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/Thunderstruck-AI-\n\nData connection catalogue (what kind of data our platform can handle): http://eventcatalog.metanomic.net/\n\nTech architecture map: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GslYHTg-B--5k_HMpcg7s0eRQdTurLU6ErVBhSuCogA/edit#slide=id.g10f846c6006_0_0\n\nOur primary focus now is to place these powerful tools into the hands of the Web3 creator economy by partnering with key metaverse players and platforms - like Decentraland.

We witnessed multiple potential tenants reaching out to us to learn more about the rental process as our website helped them connect with land owners. However, we also soon learned that Decentraland remains largely inaccessible to the average person looking to advertise, market their products, or celebrate/host events on it.\n\nWhile we were able to make the lands more discoverable through our platform, the process of actually using the land remains much more complicated. Decentraland allows land owners to grant temporary edit permissions to another user for their land (https://docs.decentraland.org/market/land-manager/#give-permissions) but in order for the tenants to work with it, they need to be well-versed with deploying code to build something in DCL. The problem is that in many cases the tenants don’t really need these permissions and just want to connect and work with the land owner on how they plan to use the land. \n\nThink of the following major use cases for example:\n1.  A production company wants to promote their upcoming film on someone’s land, they would like to directly ask the land owner to put up a poster or some other graphic on a particular asset on the land, for instance, a billboard. Or basically, any other company looking to advertise or market their product’s info on someone’s land.\n2. A family wants to celebrate a birthday party or some other similar event in DCL, they want to use an existing parcel/estate without any changes and all they require is the land owner’s help to let them host the event. \n\nNeither of these above cases require the involvement of a smart contract or any sort of transfer of ownership or other permissions, and the whole process can be worked out simply by connecting and communicating with potential tenants. And so, RentParcel will build a platform that will make it extremely simple to connect with land owners for anyone who’s trying to utilize Decentraland but doesn’t have any advanced knowledge of crypto, nfts, or the metaverse.  \n\nHow is this happening currently?\n\nCurrently, if potential customers want to connect with land owners they do it largely through Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media sources, which is mostly unorganized. There are also metaverse real estate agents and advertising firms that act as middlemen or brokers for facilitating ‘rentals’. Our vision is to democratize access to Decentraland land and create a level playing field in terms of opportunities for land owners. By building a peer-to-peer marketplace, we would be able to have a single dedicated space where anyone can connect with DCL land owners, use their land, leave reviews, and just help make the entire process more open, accessible, and transparent.","specification":"RentParcel will streamline the process of using someone’s land - we plan to model our website in the following manner:\n\n1. For land owners: Land owners would go to our website and create a post for their property (wallet integration will not be mandatory) which will also include the price per day for using their land and the availability.  \n\n2. For customers (any person, entity, or organisation) looking to use DCL land for whatever their need is - renting, marketing, events, etc., would then browse through this website and select their property of interest and duration (for which they intend to use the land), and they will then request to communicate directly with the land owner. \n\nThe land owner will then get a notification that someone is interested in their land and it will be up to them to accept/reject the invite to initiate the conversation. Once the details such as price, duration, etc are finalized, RentParcel will let the land owner set a price and duration which would be then sent to the tenant customer to accept. The exact reason for using the land will be something that will be worked out between the two parties.      \n\nIn addition, we will also include features that can be found on popularly existing marketplace like websites such as leaving reviews/ratings both for landlords and customers, searching, filtering on price, land type, size, etc.\n\nWe plan to use the requested funds for the following:\n1. Accelerating the development of the project and creating informational content - we will hire more developers to expedite the completion of the project.

The answer is simply to harness the power of the cloud, efficiently and securely.\n\nWith a combined 30+ years of experience in cloud consulting with some of the largest fortune 500 companies through infrastructure, development, automation, and cybersecurity. Not to mention we’re a strong player within the community – Serraform is uniquely positioned to deliver a self-service video streaming platform for Decentraland that is fully-automated and simple to use.\n\nWith your support, we plan to further invest in the development of a streaming platform hosted in the cloud and secured with state-of-the-art cybersecurity and compliant solutions. To do this we need to take what we’ve learned and built so far and automate its ability to service you at a moment’s notice. We need the service to scale beyond what our team can manage and let anybody use it themselves when they want, while reducing overall running costs for the community.\n\nWe need to develop an interface and an API that can be used for any parcel owner to leverage the power of our streaming platform, allowing the ability for users to upload any audio/video file for streaming, or copy/paste in a Twitch/YouTube stream URL for those who prefer that route. We also know the community wants to broadcast Zoom podcasts or OBS streams directly into Decentraland but lack the ability to do it at scale and without jitter – we've been servicing all these use-cases, and now we need to package it up in a simple to use service for anybody to use on their own time. Simply upload your video, paste your link, or request a RTMP URL/key and let the fully automated service handle the rest.\n\nIf you’re a developer you might build an interface inside Decentraland or within your own tool if you prefer not to use ours, then leverage our API to deliver on the streaming magic for you. Rent out your venue and allow guests to control their content natively inside your own parcel. Have a club night where your VIP guests control the stream via Twitch or a jukebox collection of content over a stream deck you built!

We believe the solution should be cloud-native and have no single points of failure or need for manual intervention, while being able to deliver on your security and compliance needs with maximum horsepower and optimum user experience across the globe.\n\nIn addition to our proposed website UI, we plan to develop an API ‘under the hood’ to allow 3rd party app integration, allowing anybody to integrate their own parcel and control preferences with our streaming solution, either in-game or through 3rd party tooling or websites. **Why not build your own jukebox collection and let party-goers control your screens within your parcel? Imagine building a stream deck inside your venue!**\n\nThe content will be encoded with H.264 studio-grade quality up to 1080p, optimized for Decentraland events, and securely stored using Microsoft’s award-winning Defender security toolset. The streams will be provided as adaptive M3U8 streams, meaning various bitrates and resolutions will be available, accommodating any bandwidth limitations – this basically means **you get a buffer-free experience on every stream at the best quality possible anywhere and on any device**.\n\nThe service will support ingestion of any external stream (via OBS or Zoom for example) using an RTMP URL/key pair, but also **be able to broadcast streams directly from Twitch and/or YouTube** if you already have a URL.\n\nWe plan to leverage Verizon’s global premium CDN network allowing for dedicated content delivery to anybody around the world at very low latency and zero buffering.

This limits the ability to release collections that would benefit from a more nuanced number (i.e., 50, 2500, 1999). A workaround involves minting greater than needed then burning the excess. I aim to allow for a simplified process from the start.","motivation":"Decentraland (DCL) is the only NFT marketplace that does not allow for custom minting amounts. Considering other platforms allow this flexibility, I feel DCL should also allow this basic feature. As a prolific publisher, I at times struggle to choose an appropriate rarity tier for my items. The most common tiers used, Legendary, Epic, and Rare, have mint amounts spread to far apart, 100, 1000, and 5000 respectively. Currently the rarity tiers are:\n\nUnique: 1\n\nMythic: 10\n\nLegendary: 100\n\nEpic: 1000\n\nRare: 5000\n\nUncommon: 10,000\n\nCommon: 100,000\n\nThe two methods to circumvent this restrictive system are:\n\n1.)\tTo create and burn excess mints.\n\n2.)\tCreate your own contract and go through the Linked Wearables Registry.\n\nThere are a few issues with those. To create and burn causes undue burden for the creator and the network. Further, depending on how many are burned, invalidates the rarity color system. With Linked Wearables, this option is less-than-often applicable to the intent of the publisher. Linked wearables have no rarity designation and are not able to be sold or traded within DCL. They are simply DCL representations of External NFTs you may already own.\nAs you can see the current system leaves much to be desired.","specification":"I propose removing the minting tiers system and to allow the publisher to specify any number of mints, up to a maximum of 100,000.  This will enable creators to choose custom mint amounts specific to their own needs, while also keeping a high maximum on possible mints.\n\nUpon submitting a request to publish a wearable, the user will specify the maximum number of mints for the item instead of specifying a rarity tier.  Legacy values from the tier system can be used as suggested guidelines or defaults.  \nThe wearables submission page, rarity fields in the builder, and wearable smart contracts will be updated by the DCL development team in order to accommodate the new system.","conclusion":"By enabling Creators and Publishers to have greater freedom of their collections through expanding the minting amount options, DCL will benefit from increased creativity and expression. This is a simple change to bring DCL to parity to other platforms and encourage continued user growth.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":13418,"scores_total":8410.142386715852,"votes":32,"manaVP":1610.1423867158521,"landVP":6000,"namesVP":800,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"66d76070-0d27-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b","snapshot_id":"bafkreifyhjbq3m4vyob5r74r5les2wsbrrhyabdw55r2zwrdyxc3kxk23m","user":"0xe400a85a6169bd8be439bb0dc9eac81f19f26843","type":"grant","title":"Creation of DAO-Owned Data Aggregation Layer for Decentraland Core","start_at":"2022-07-26T21:10:00.863Z","finish_at":"2022-08-09T21:10:00.862Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Creation of DAO-Owned Data Aggregation Layer for Decentraland Core","abstract":"We believe Decentraland player usage data should be collected by the DAO and made available to all Decentraland users.\n \nUser location data is currently available through use of the /islands endpoint on DCL content server nodes.

Often the first question asked of teams looking to build or sell in Decentraland focuses on the metaverse itself and not the team’s use case; although Decentraland is the most decentralized metaverse it still exists in a competitive landscape. Investors and clients often need to justify investment or choice of metaverse before they can start to focus on a team’s specific use case.\n \nBy providing data on Daily Active Users, Total User Growth of Decentraland, and traffic by parcel, builders can refer to these open source analytics instead of each team attempting to obtain them by themselves.\n \n**2. \tPrevent undue load on Decentraland Infrastructure**\n \nWhile the data in question is public, everyone cannot query this data for themselves without an adverse impact on Decentraland nodes.\n \nThere has already been discussion in the forums about shutting down external access to player position data due to increased loads felt by Decentraland content server nodes. Too many concurrent requests to these endpoints would have the effect of a DDoS attack which could impact the quality of the service each node can provide.\n \nTherefore instead of a) playing out the Tragedy of the Commons that would occur if everyone collected the data for themselves, b) removing access such that nobody can benefit from this data, or c) allowing the data to be acquired by the highest bidder/private entity – we believe the ecosystem will benefit most from the data collection being done once and everyone sharing in access to that data.\n \n**3. \tPrevent Private Monopolization of the Data**\n \nWe at Atlas CORP have first-hand knowledge of how valuable this data can be to those operating in Decentraland. User position data can be used to determine how many users attended events – critical for event hosts to understand how well their event performed. Daily active user data is crucial to those seeking to invest in the metaverse to help understand returns on investment.\n \nWe believe that no private institution should be able to gate-keep this information from the rest of the community. We at Atlas CORP used to make this information freely available using our own private hosting infrastructure, but we outpaced our capacity requiring a move to more dynamic scaling solutions. This is why we’re here talking about this proposal.\n\n**tl;dr**\n \nThe DAO can provide the Decentraland community a free source of user data via API for up to one year for the cost of $57,300. The existence of this data set will help to grow the builder and entrepreneurial community by providing important metrics needed to win clients and funding, and prevent monopolization by private entities. Atlas CORP is the suitable candidate for this development given an extensive history in Decentraland data collection and analytics.","specification":"**What Data is in Scope?**\n \nThis proposal is only for Decentraland user data as reported by the /comms/islands endpoint on Decentraland Content Servers.\n \nThis proposal does NOT include:\n* Content Server data (e.g. scene files, user profile history)\n* Scene-specific data (e.g. object clicks and interactions)\n* Any personally identifiable information (PII), excluding ETH wallet address\n* User IRL location data\n* Any derived content from a user’s ETH wallet\n \nData will be collected from all active, registered Decentraland Content Servers which at the time of writing includes hephaestus, hela, heimdallr, baldr, loki, dg, odin, unicorn, marvel, and athena.\n \nThis data set can provide a platform for building more sophisticated reports by the DCL developer community. The DAO could also choose to one day monetize access to this data (e.g. when the data is being used directly for profit), as well as augment what data is collected and made available. It is important to note that this proposal is currently limited in scope to the one data set and free access to the community, and that these next steps may be the subject of future proposals.\n  \n**How will this work?**\n \nData will be collected every 20 seconds and piped into a Mongo Atlas cloud database, with a Digital Ocean server set up to provide API access to queries on the data.\n \nAn automated feed will be set up to collect data from an authoritative source of each active DAO node. Collecting data every 20 seconds will result in 3 datapoints a minute; graphs using one-minute granularity will have 3 datapoints on which to aggregate data points per minute. Data collection will be set up redundantly on two or more servers, or on a single load-balanced cluster, to minimize downtime in data collection. This data is expected to grow at 1Gb per day, which may accelerate with the growth of daily active users.\n \nAs the data is natively in JSON, we propose to use Mongo Atlas as the cloud database of choice. The database will also be deployed with multiple nodes to minimize downtime. Mongo provides an easy way to scale for future needs – whether through increasing storage capacity or sharding the deployment for increased API and query load.\n \nTo minimize infrastructure costs, we propose keeping only 3 months of data available for public consumption. A process will be designed to backup, purge, and post/host historical data such that users can perform historical analysis without excessive cost to the DAO.\n \nAn API server will be written to provide simplified API access to the data in the database. These queries may include things like – users per minute (global or per parcel), daily active users (global or per parcel), and unique Decentraland visitors (global or per parcel). The API code can be made open source and hosted on GitLab, but hosted privately on Digital Ocean to prevent unauthorized access to the DAO’s database. Additional access can be granted to additional DAO representatives if deemed appropriate.\n \nAPI access will remain open, although a throttling mechanism will be put in place per IP address to prevent DDoS of the API servers. In addition, query data (e.g. who’s asking for what) could be saved in the database and made available as APIs for complete transparency.\n \nA dashboard will be made available to show recent Decentraland population data and daily active users for the reportable data set.","personnel":"The Development Team\n \nThe development of this data platform would be done by the Atlas Corporation [@atlascorp_dcl](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl) team, who have extensive experience working with this data set:\n \n* HowieDoin – Lead Analytics & Infrastructure innovation\n* MorrisMustang – Lead DCL & Solidity innovation\n* JosephAaron – Operations and task management\n* StaleDegree – Senior Solidity/UI Development\n* RyanNFT – Junior Developer","roadmap":"**What will this cost the Decentraland DAO?**\n \nThis project will cost the DAO $57,300 and will take approximately 3 months to develop.\n \nThis breaks down into:\n \n**$7,500.00*** **- Infrastructure and Hosting Costs:**\n* Budget for Mongo Atlas DB for one year\n* Budget for Digital Ocean API servers for one year\n* Budget for Digital Ocean Data collection servers for one year\n* ENS domain for three years\n\n**This estimate is based on current pricing for each of the above platforms. $7,500 may not last a full year if pricing is altered by the provider.*\n \n**$45,000.00- Development Costs (estimated 3 month delivery)**\n* Data collection with redundancy and failover to set up the data collection \nrails\n* API query development resources to produce queries and prevent \noveruse\n* DevOps and infrastructure development resources to automate as much \nas possible\n* Technical Writing resources to provide user-facing API documentation\n* Front-end development resources to create the dashboard\n \n**$4,800 - Ongoing Support Costs (3 months post deployment)**\n* Code updates when breaking changes occur due to external forces\n* API query user support in the Decentraland discord","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":13409,"scores_total":3868687.136637649,"votes":75,"manaVP":334591.4333183406,"landVP":268000,"namesVP":114400,"delegatedVP":3151695.7033193093,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"99986a30-0cb5-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b","snapshot_id":"bafkreieck4ay7lsd26nbu7dlr2yyymy3ttb7bdu6fvc7odueq2vd3j3uiq","user":"0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2b9c4b263","type":"grant","title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","start_at":"2022-07-26T07:36:00.387Z","finish_at":"2022-08-02T07:36:00.386Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","abstract":"Vueltta is an international art collective creating immersive experiences in Decentraland.

These include [Zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan), [Kim Asendorf](https://twitter.com/kimasendorf), [AL Crego](https://twitter.com/ALCrego_), [VNCCII](https://twitter.com/VNCCII_OFFICIAL), [Loackme](https://twitter.com/loackme_) and [Tim Maxwell](https://twitter.com/maxwellinked). It will also be seen by Hide Uehara, Director of business development for [Square Enix](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix), the Japanese conglomerate behind [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy), as well as brands like [EssilorLuxottica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EssilorLuxottica).\n\nThe conference organisers expect at least 900 visitors. The Labyrinth Effect will be live-streamed into the exhibition hall of the event, where Vueltta artists will demonstrate the project and assist new users. We are also confirmed to present the project on a main conference stage. \n\nTo engage the NFT Europe Show audience further we plan several live events over the show dates. These will also be publicised on DCL discords and open to all: \n\n- Guided Labyrinth Walks with Vueltta Artists\n- Labyrinth Flash Mobs\n\nVideo and photography from these events will be shared across social media. The team's previous events gained 250+ visitors/week through social media promotion alone. We expect visitor data to be much higher when combined with our NFT Show Europe presence, and will report all figures back to the DAO.\n\nFilm and photography from The Labyrinth Effect will be used in presentations for future creative industry summits.","specification":"The Labyrinth Effect will be designed and built by Vueltta, then deployed by our land collaborators. \n\nWe have already confirmed our collaborations for the two build locations:\n\n**Indie Village - location for The Tower Labyrinth**\n\nLand collaboration by [Bill Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-burns-86505059/), gallery build by [KJ Walker](https://www.lowpolymodelsworld.com/) \n\n[Indie Village](https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I4zft&position=100%2C30&realm=dg) is a 20-acre master-planned virtual development that aims to become the premier cultural destination of the metaverse.

That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed.

This makes live events infeasible. For example, live video calls or interactive events take 20 seconds to get a response.\n\nThis project introduces new ultra low latency streaming components to the decentraland SDK and builder to support ultra low latency video. Latency will reduce to ~1 second.\n\nThese components will allow scene builders to easily incorporate ultra low latency video in their scenes.\n\n### Background\n\nIn recent years, global investment in technology and infrastructure underlying ultra low latency video streaming has been significant.  Live streaming is set to explode in the coming years with low latency video being a big driver behind new applications in entertainment, gaming, media, education, acedemia.\n\nUltra low latency video streaming typically operates on a sub 1 second delay.\nThis project will integrate this hot, deep technology into the Decentraland platform.\n\n### Competitive Advantage\n\nMetaverses such as Facebook's Meta already have native low-latency video\nand are building a strong portfolio of apps based on this technology. Other\nMetaverses do not yet have low latency video streaming technology.\n\n### Experimental Prototype\n\nA video demonstration of the components I have developed is here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ml7nlTEk3p8\n\nThis video shows a working prototype of an experimental Decentraland SDK component featuring a low latency video stream.\n\nThe video is streaming from North America to a video streaming server in Hong Kong (on Microsoft Azure) and then back to North America and into a Decentraland scene running in the browser.\n\nThe clock times on the right side are the current time whereas the time on the left, in the Decentraland scene, are latent due to the transit time around the planet and the subsequent decoding and rendering of the video.\n\nTotal time is demonstrated to be around 1 second.\n\nA 5 year old laptop with no GPU was used for the test. The video resolution is set to 640x360.\n\nThe experimental prototype includes modifications to the Decentraland Unity Renderer and Kernel and adds a new video component to the SDK.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a virtual future that runs on a 20 second delay.  Use cases that need lower latency might include:\n\n- Any live interaction such as video calls.\n- Live events where people communicate from the virtual world to the real world.\n- Any use cases that include augmentation of the virtual world with a real object (augmented virtuality).\n- Virtual workspaces\n- Virtual learning spaces that requires interaction\n- Remote control of real world devices such as drones. (yikes!)\n- Immersive commerce\n- Gaming applications\n\n### Existing DAO pre-Proposal\n\nAn existing pre-proposal that covers this feature is here, from Tobik#7989. Note however this is a request for a protocol change, the proposed feature would likely be an additional component so that backwards compatibility is maintained:\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","specification":"### High Level Summary\n\nThe project objective is to create a feature to enable scene builders to easily incorporate low latency video into their scenes. To be successful the feature needs to be well engineered, tested, documented, incorporate ideas from dev and user communities and comply with Decentraland standards.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Deliver WebRTC ultra low video and audio streaming components to the Decentraland SDK.\n- Support for Decentraland web client and feasibility of development on new Desktop client on supported platforms.\n- Complete all relevant requirement, archiectural, design, code, test and deployment work to decentraland's standard via github.  \n- Run relevant user testing and trials.\n- Operate a streaming test server until mid November 2022 for development and community testing.\n- Create test scenes, sdk documentations, blogs and assist Decentraland marketing team on new feature launch.\n- Be responsive to community and be present in relevant channel on Discord.\n- Attend some sweet dcl live events that use the new technology.\n\n### Preliminary Work Completed\n\nA feasibility study was completed prior to grant application request:\n- Talking to potential users and understanding their applications.\n- Review of code and relevant architectural components.\n- Reading Dcl code standards and architecture documentation.\n- Research of ECS (sdk) structure and dev of new components.\n- Review of existing decentraland video components.\n- Review of WebRTC options for Unity and their pros and cons.\n- Building new environment across Explorer, Kernel and Unity Renderer.

This is due to slow regulatory adoption in some countries, poor adoption of online payment technology, and weak communication and localization infrastructure.\n\nWe aim to tackle the third issue.\n\nSolution\n\nWe want to develop a high quality Arabic Youtube series, targeting Arab gaming communities, and educating them on three topics: 1) The Metavers / GameFi sector, 2) Decentraland, 3) Economic potential of the P2E model and other models to the residents of MENA.\n\nThe series will consist of 12 videos, ranging between 7 - 10 minutes.\n\nThe first six videos will focus on the Metaverse in general, starting with what is the Metaverse and how it works, then moving to the concept of Ecosystem and how different Metaverses have different rich ecosystems of gamers and builders. We will go through the big players in the Metaverse sphere so far, including the biggest Metaverse projects, biggest gaming companies entering the field, specially ones that are popular in MENA (e.g. Ubisoft), as well as celebrities and artists entering the field and developing their own virtual project.\n\nWe will then proceed to talk about the most prominent milestones that the industry has gone through so far, whether on the levels of adoption or development. We will explore collaborative and collective initiatives emerging in the sphere, such as guilds, alliances and aggregators, and lastly, we will offer an overview on the future of the Metaverse and potential of wider adoption.\n\nIn the second part of the series, which will consist of three videos, we will explore Decentraland as an entry point to gamers and builders alike to the Metaverse sphere. We will cover Decentraland's history, then explore in one video from a player's prospective, and in an other video from developer's prospective.\n\nThe last three videos will revolve around the economic potential of the Metaverse and GameFi for MENA residents. We will cover three main pillars of the Metaverse economy: Play-to-Earn models, virtual events and tours, and the virtual real estate market.\n\nGoals\n\n1- Raise awareness about the Metaverse and GameFi and their economic potential amongst MENA's gaming communities.\n2- Introduce Decentraland as an entry point to the Metaverse / GameFi sphere to MENA users.\n3- Provide a series that can serve as a reference point for Arabic videos that delve into the Metaverse with more details.","specification":"We have already produced a sample video for the series.

The original map of 301x301 parcels was great to bootstrap the project by generating LAND scarcity, but it’s already too small for our community. What’s worse, many LANDs are in the hands of speculators who will never deploy content to the world.   \n\nMy proposed solution? Continuous LAND issuance. Every day, or every week, the protocol can auction a new LAND, and the highest bidder can spawn a new LAND at any coordinate adjacent to an already existing one. If nobody wants to bid, no LAND is created for that period. Believe it or not, this was the original scheme for LAND issuance, and how the first testnet worked. Yes, this would reduce prices for already existing LANDs, but… if only whales can buy LANDs, other metaverses will kill Decentraland and your LAND will be worthless. Let’s make Genesis City the first of many cities in Decentraland!\n\nThis is an initial poll to gather community sentiment on this (potentially sensitive) topic.

That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed.

Link to our website https://cenmodels.com\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years. We sincerely love games and our work. A year ago, we started to see the potential in Decentraland. We studied the specifics of Decentraland and spent thousands of hours at work. And now, when we know we can create high-quality content, we turn to DAO, to people who believe in the success of Decentraland as much as we do and who, like us, want to participate in its development. We know it is only the beginning of our great journey in improving the Decentraland.\n \n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland, which will entail its advancement.\n \n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won't be a 100% copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics for several reasons:\n- Specifics of computer games. \n- Limitations of Decentraland. \n- Rules that are easy to understand. Even if you didn't play games like D&D before. \nOther reasons.\n\n\nExamples of different game mechanics:\n- A session in D&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n- An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n- Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating them themselves.\n\n \nExpenditure of funds:\n- Purchasing a 2x3 land to place the game on it. To date, the cheapest 2x3 plots are in this price range. People who have made content for Decentraland or have some knowledge about Builder know that acceptable values for triangles, materials, textures, and so on depend on the number of adjacent sections. The 2x3 plot is the minimum size to make beautiful and diverse models of characters, scenery, effects, and other things. (22 000 - 30 000$)\n\n- Programmer's salary. A programmer is one of the most important specialists in game development. (16 000 - 18 000$)\n\n- The salary of two 3d artists. Our modelers face a difficult task. They need to meet the scene's limitations but, at the same time, make a lot of diverse, maximally optimized models. (14 000 - 16 000$)\n\n- Game designer's salary. The game designer will have to think through all the game mechanics and assemble them into a single whole. (8000 - 10 000$)\n\n- Gamemaster's salary. As I said before, our team is big fans of D&D, but we decided to call a professional for the role of the gamemaster. The gamemaster will create 2 intriguing game scenarios with many ramifications and a variety of game passing. They will come up with characters, their personalities, the world and the laws by which they live, and much more. (4000 - 5000$)\n\n- Artist's salary. The artist will draw hero cards, interfaces, backgrounds, and so on. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Sound designer's salary. Audio is a crucial component of the atmosphere for better immersion. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Other expenses. Various services, servers, etc. (5 000$)\n\n- Marketing. We will cover this amount using our own funds. We need to make a statement! (10 000 - 12 000$)","specification":"First, the gamemaster and the game designer will create the game's foundation. They'll decide which mechanics to replicate from D&D, which to change, and which to add. They'll develop 2 adventure scenarios and think through all the dialogues, the variability of actions, characters, etc.\n Then they split into two teams:\n1) The gamemaster will start working with an artist, a sound designer, and one of the 3d artists. This team will be responsible for the lore of the game, its appearance, and its sound.\n2) The game designer will work with a programmer and a second 3d artist. Their main task will be to make gameplay and smart objects.\nEven though they'll divide into two other teams, both groups will work closely to ensure that all aspects of the game are compatible.\n\n\nHow we see the final result (in short):\nEach player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences. The characters get into some situations and receive a task. For example, players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf. The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions (\"Inspect the tavern,\" \"Approach the tavern and start talking to him\"...). Some actions' success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, in \"Strike a stealthy attack at a robber,\" - you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is, for example, 10; you roll the dice, if <10 falls out - you missed, >10 - you hit. In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players' characters have died.\nFor a complete understanding, check out D&D if you don't know what kind of game it is.\n\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.","personnel":"- Programmer.

This means ALL of us need our own terms and conditions built into our properties and any and all appropriate licenses to communicate music.\n\nWe have been having discussions with SOCAN (the music licensing body in Canada), about the best way to approach protecting artists in the web3 space and the most appropriate way to move forward with licensing. Ultimately, SOCAN is a not-for-profit that exists to ensure artists get royalties from license fees whenever and wherever their work is communicated.\n\nTo be clear, SOCAN is not on a witch hunt, but these issues WILL be resolved with or without us. Now is the time for us to have an impact on what music licensing looks like in the web3 space. Together with these licensing bodies, we believe that we can build a bright future where everyone is protected and creators receive proper compensation for the communication of their works, whether at events in the meta, distribution of music via NFT, etc.\n\nWhether we like it or not, the reality is that licensing needs to be addressed. We propose doing a Twitter Spaces AMA with SOCAN on July 28th to educate the community on current regulations and start the discussion about the best way to license this new space.\nWe are of the opinion that DAO funds should be used to blanket license anyone who purchases land to allow for more creative freedom to communicate music.

This is what DCL set out to do, co-create the Metaverse, but believe there can be more contributors to the Metaverse puzzle. \n\nOur guiding compass is to encourage architecture in the Metaverse and to develop a new economic model for architects/3D designers in the process of architecting the Metaverse. With an active influx of high-quality buildings to DCL there will be more experiences for users rather than vast areas of barren land. We are also confident that monthly user adoption and user-generated events will also rise. For such a task to occur we need to revolutionise the way the marketplace, builder and SDK currently operate. \n\nRenovi believes that to build further, more complex and enticing experiences within DCL the correct stakeholders need to be rewarded for creating. This implies that high-quality, professional architects/3D designers but also upcoming talent needs to be interested and more importantly motivated to create for the Metaverse. \n\nArchitects/3D Designers can now break their real-life moulds and find new monetary avenues by leveraging their efforts for exponential development through DCL. \n\nFollowing on from our successful poll “Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?” (Link: https://bit.ly/3P1dybU) we have taken onboard the feedback from the various stakeholders and revised our approach to offer a better solution. \n\nWe aim to create cross-platform compatible 3D asset NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. We want to create a seamless experience in which a creator can upload a 3D asset in Renovi Marketplace (or any other marketplace) and put it for sale. Consequently the buyer of that 3D asset now an NFT will be able to navigate directly from the marketplace to the DCL builder in which they can find the asset as a new asset pack. Within a few clicks, they should be able to place the asset on their land and if further alterations are required they can download the scene so it can be altered on the SDK. \n\nTo achieve this we will integrate the Renovi marketplace to DCL by building part of the DCL API links so that 3D assets are compatible and can be presented in the builder as long as they belong to the respective user’s wallet. This will enable us to automate the current procedure. Currently, the buyer of a 3D asset needs to download it and reupload it to the builder while at the same time there is no clear way of ensuring they are the owners of that building as an NFT. We will offer a single, simple streamlined solution for DCL.\n\nAs part of giving back to the community, we will also need to ensure that there is API compatibility between DCL products and Renovi Marketplace or any other marketplace. We want to make it possible that everyone who purchases a 3D asset as an NFT that is compatible with DCL can connect their wallet, navigate to the builder of DCL and be able to find the respective 3D asset as an external asset pack that can be placed on their land.\n\nOur goal is to automate the implementation pipeline, and indirectly add buildings as NFTs into DCL by opening up the builder and its capabilities to a wider audience.\n\nWebsite: https://renovi.io  \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/eMEPwxCyEk  \n\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3P3MNn2","specification":"How can we achieve this?\n\nTo achieve a technical specification of this magnitude, we will need to carefully craft and technically architect each stage of our infrastructure and execution. This will entail developing an API, which we will label as the “industry standard” prototype for interoperable communication. Developing a standard will be subject to outlining in full, all parameters that are currently present within DCL technical ecosystem. E.g. project name, parcel type, parcel dimensions, file type, price, chain, triangles, materials, meshes, bodies, entities and textures etc. \n\nThis will be followed by documentation, enabling a user to educate themselves on creating GET/POST requests to and from the Renovi and DCL ecosystems. All API calls will be open and provided to the public to interact with. We will allow users to obtain authentication mechanisms in the form of bearer tokens, from us, which can be invoked/revoked at any time, to facilitate the usage of our API. Upon integration and authentication, with industry standards, the user will be able to interact with the API to either fetch, embed, post, and/or utilise all the parameters available for each Metaverse asset.\n\nAt MVP stages, these interactions will bypass through a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) built on NodeJS and/or equivalent, as this enables us to interact with the blockchain using web3 infrastructure. Once an API request is authenticated and a user has posted their metaverse asset for approval, their user ID, wallet ID and asset ID will be manually (at first) approved and sent to the DCL builder. The CMS will enable any admin to utilise the CRUD convention (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) along with import/exporting any assets needed, to open communication lines between the CMS and the DCL builder.

Compatibility with digital fashion is the holy grail of this task. NFT technology promises interoperability, but all games/metaverses/apps have different avatars, graphic styles, and poly-counts for assets. There is no standard. So we also have multiple 3D files for each digital outfit. In order to support “interoperability” companies drop separate NFTs compatible with different metaverses. They are not linked. It is just creating a new copy of the design. None of them are compatible. They are not very useful for use outside of the platform on which they were created, and duplicating designs for portability to different worlds blurs the ownership, value and uniqueness of assets. \n\nSolution: \nWe’ve built an infrastructure that allows a single EVM-compatible asset to be worn not only in the game marketplace it was bought in, but in all worlds, everywhere it goes it converts to the appearance of the platform it’s in. We tap into the backend of metaverse marketplaces to make these assets tradable in-game. On the contrary of our competitors, who drop separate NFTs compatible for the different virtual worlds, our infrastructure does not create a duplicate of NFTs. Each 1 NFT works as an access pass to the compatible version of 3D asset for multiple metaverses/games/VR/AR/Zoom filters etc.\n\n\nDecentraland have been the first who started to support linked wearable, but our project serves to extend this capability to many other worlds and provide single window for the users/brands/metaverses.","specification":"We have described our tech in the following article: https://medium.com/gravity-the-studio\n\nOur demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNAj7YMWpSo&t=1s \nOur website:  https://gravitylayer.io\nGithub: https://github.com/Gravity-Studio-Digital-Wear\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gravitylayer/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GravitySkins\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Ejh4jEPRDC\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravitylayer/","personnel":"Our team for now consist of 10 full time team members and 2 ongoing freelancers.\nOur CEO and co-founder background is in ad agencies, her master’s research was in 3D fashion and digital identity.

For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.\n\nWhy have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.\n\nAs member of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to do the triage and answer the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentralan Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address and amount to be paid and also, shall contact  the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.\n\nThe program is composed of different threat levels and topics:\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t\t**Up to USD 500 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t                **Up to USD 20 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t        **USD 1 000**\n\n**Websites and Applications**\n\nCritical\t\t\t\t        **USD 18 000**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t       **USD 6 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t\t       **USD 3 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t       **USD 1 000**\n\nPayouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.\n\nThe program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommend the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).\n\nThe Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":12995,"scores_total":1383624.2788279587,"votes":42,"manaVP":140433.60888972672,"landVP":190000,"namesVP":18500,"delegatedVP":1034690.6699382318,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"2f347730-fec6-11ec-8f44-ef1722f0509f","snapshot_id":"bafkreiewtx4ckotlrdvjoug5ac5kingcf5qlhhzsh5hoegjnbxehtmov3e","user":"0x3026e5dca7a3f50a482d5f06fb18ce607386531b","type":"poll","title":"Would you like custom spawn points or ability to spawn in at last location?","start_at":"2022-07-08T13:59:00.060Z","finish_at":"2022-07-13T13:59:00.057Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Would you like custom spawn points or ability to spawn in at last location?","description":"I want to ask the community what thier thoughts on this are.\nWould you like to see custom spawn points in DCL?\nor\nSpawn at the location you logged off?\n\nI think having custom spawn points would be a great feature to have, especially for the DCL Client","choices":["Custom Spawns","Spawn at last location","Either ","No im happy spawning at default location","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":12987,"scores_total":659533.5865533607,"votes":36,"manaVP":27920.370959982665,"landVP":98000,"namesVP":83000,"delegatedVP":450613.215593378,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"cc330280-fe95-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a","snapshot_id":"QmUFjDXqAyfeXYvc5J34PYdZbMg8Q7dfAxRNCbH3uWx9dU","user":"0xb53543102afa4a21b07d78c94f33306777487274","type":"linked_wearables","title":"Add neuno - digital fashion company to the Linked Wearables Registry","start_at":"2022-07-08T08:13:00.112Z","finish_at":"2022-07-15T08:13:00.112Z","required_to_pass":4000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"neuno - digital fashion company","links":["https://neuno.io/","https://twitter.com/neuno_io","https://diesel.neuno.io/","https://discord.com/invite/neuno","https://market.decentraland.org/collections/0xdd0242fe5e22ac76211fd6fa45fa9579294961c3","https://uk.diesel.com/en/sneakers/s-prototype-low/8051385367945.html"],"nft_collections":"## The Diesel x neuno Alpha Drop\n\nDiesel S.p.A. is an Italian retail clothing company, located in Breganze, Italy. It sells denim, and other clothing, footwear, and accessories.\n\nDiesel Alpha is digital representation of [Diesel Prototype Sneakers](https://tinyurl.com/9un5p4pk) .

This poll is being presented to the community to determine if there is a want or need to filter (hide) some of the wearable designs which may cause cause discomfort to members of our growing community.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nDecentraland is a globally accessible platform that invites users from all communities to be able to interact, build, and contribute to the social and economic aspects of the platform.  Everyone should feel welcome and safe in our virtual world.  Currently the decisions as to whether an item should be allowed or not allowed fall on the wearable curation team.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  Anyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nProposed classes of items which might be considered mature would include sexually provocative items which 'show too much skin', weapons, and wearables which have blood.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  My goal in suggesting the creation of such a filter is NOT to censor anyone.  I feel it would actually allow for even more mature content to be created.\n\nIMPACTS\n\nAnyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.  By giving each user the ability to curate their own experience, the need to curate this aspect of wearables will be removed and the team to focus on more important issues.  Implementation of this proposal could allow for more provocative wearable designs, more realistic weapon designs, and the approval of wearables which were not allowed due to violation of guidelines which the wearables curation team have to oblige by.  \n\nIt would also allow for a more welcoming environment for users and communities who might use Decentraland if they had the ability to filter out mature content they don't deem appropriate.  Schools, business professionals, and other more conservative groups are among those who might benefit from the filters.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nA default grouping system for each type of mature content themed wearable comes to mind.  Each group could be toggled on and off at the users discretion.  I'm suggesting one group for weapons, one group for sexually suggestive wearables, one group for wearables containing blood ect.  This filter would need to be developed by the foundation or an external dev team for these default options.  \n\nThe addition of an allow list and a block list which could be accessible in a user interface panel would also be greatly beneficial, so that specific wearables of a users choosing could be shown or hidden.  By adding the contact address(es) of any wearable to the allow/block lists, literally any item could be hidden from view if a user chooses. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEveryone should feel safe and comfortable in DCL.  This proposed solution would give the power of choice to each individual user, and allow content creators to express themselves in a fully decentralized way.  If this poll meets the threshold for approval, I will work on developing a more in depth proposal.  I understand there will be a cost associated with the development, and will recruit the assistance of qualified advisors to determine what an actual cost would be.  My plan is to work with DAO committee members, code developers, and the community to make this proposal as solid and executable as possible.","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":12964,"scores_total":939418.9244881256,"votes":34,"manaVP":23610.64416500122,"landVP":106000,"namesVP":22800,"delegatedVP":787008.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"d43ed210-fd5f-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a","snapshot_id":"bafkreigwdurbmuocxyexu4iyafxm7syo5jxowc2peussh5v4d2psm5wtxa","user":"0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d","type":"draft","title":"POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect","start_at":"2022-07-06T19:14:00.625Z","finish_at":"2022-07-13T19:14:00.624Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"78635ac0-c4d8-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4","title":"POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect","summary":"Update the current POI management mechanism by removing the centralized list and unifying it with the decentralized DAO-maintained list, migrate that list to Polygon (cost reduction) and outside of Aragon (Better UX)","abstract":"This proposal aims to solve the existing complexity created by having two POI lists, [one centralized under the Decentraland Foundation](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) and the other maintained by the DAO using an Aragon smart contract.

This will be communicated to the Decentraland community via Discord and the Forum.\n\n-The actions to be orchestrated will be: Delete the Legacy POI list, enact the addition of the new POIs on the DAO-maintained list by the DAO Committee (Ideally those two actions should happen synchronously), and migrate the DAO-maintained list to Polygon.\n\n-Communicate to the community the result of these actions.","conclusion":"By doing this we keep empowering Decentraland users to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and reducing the costs of adding and removing POIs.

Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.\n\nMetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.\n\nOur intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale. The MetaMundo platform integration will also function as an active onramp for new 3D artists into Decentraland.\n\nReference links:\n\n [Website](https://metamundo.co/)\n\n [Discord](https://discord.gg/metamundo)\n\n [Twitter](https://twitter.com/metamundo_NFT)\n\n[Medium](https://metamundo.medium.com/)","specification":"To develop a seamless deployment solution, it’s important to describe and breakdown how MetaMundo supports 3D creators to optimize and mint their models into 3D NFTs optimized for Decentraland. The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.\n\nWe will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.\n\nOur servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.\n\nWe plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.\n\nOur goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:\n\n![ZenGarden by Dutchtide!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-ukbQAoh7USitMFCzs8C13fUd6PW9PhY \"ZenGarden by Dutchtide\")\n\n![metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lX7UaWfZR32JsFIaUcwTqVM4xIfGM9_ \"metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5\")\n\n![Creature House by Mila Lolli!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-p8jY6yd64irLt4tY3kqC5Hx5O9wQLoK \"Creature House by Mila Lolli!\")","personnel":"**Mark** - Co-founder - Serial tech entrepreneur - launched multiple platforms to empower architects, designers and creators.

This conversion pipeline will consider limitations such as size, poly count, materials, DCL Colliders, dimensions, land size constraints and components that are not supported in DCL.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12910,"scores_total":4063654.108895403,"votes":61,"manaVP":386621.492978901,"landVP":2322000,"namesVP":17400,"delegatedVP":1337632.6159165024,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"be808280-fbdd-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29","snapshot_id":"bafkreidcnicf7amzvgqpyy3pp3ydxkgenubwowll3cqvqc7f4g5ew5oomq","user":"0x059d0025e4e1bb1a37f2c922e54b139bc1231ee0","type":"poll","title":"Darkmode for DAO & Forum","start_at":"2022-07-04T21:10:00.408Z","finish_at":"2022-07-09T21:10:00.408Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Darkmode for DAO & Forum","description":"The idea behind dark mode is that it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for readability.","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":12908,"scores_total":630350.7496875472,"votes":35,"manaVP":163954.30435590696,"landVP":140000,"namesVP":84200,"delegatedVP":242196.4453316403,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"d9340f40-f96a-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29","snapshot_id":"bafkreifeqyuwvt2gmvssvfv4q7fvhfwi5dyp5u4coe6yfs4zhfuhovjpvu","user":"0xad72a1d6b06c0f79305d9996eddb723684166d11","type":"grant","title":"AllTokenFootball-The FAN Activation Network-shaping Fan Sports 3.0","start_at":"2022-07-01T18:23:00.756Z","finish_at":"2022-07-15T18:23:00.755Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"AllTokenFootball-The FAN Activation Network-shaping Fan Sports 3.0","abstract":"Fan Activation Network is a white label blockchain loyalty platform helping clubs regain the new generation of fans\nWe reconcile the digital life of the fans with their passion of the clubs thru move to earn minigames, connecting their practice to social and  engage the fan communities thru Collective Intelligence AI based solution\nWe are developing the only (with MGH ) 3D animated, mintable into NFT, avatar which not only can augment thru the won assets but being Metaverse compatible, starting with Decentraland!\nThe more you play the quicker you level up and the more prizes money can’t buy you'll have access to, such as Signed jerseys, NFTs,dream events such as training by a pro team coach and a range of immersive moments in the metaverse","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x1DfeF4AC08e6fbbfF6A88b31b48F1151a8eBB3CF","description":"A year ago in the same week Football attempted to create the super league while famous Girondins de Bordeaux went almost bankrupt signalling the end of a model giving ways to either going dystopian or utopian.

For example, excellent clothing works will be made into wearable devices, and excellent space designs will be achieved in the land of DCL.\n\n **4.

Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses. Our vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land.","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":60000,"beneficiary":"0x01F0b8e92F0ca0398482C265a99612196c8782fE","description":"Hello fellow Decentralanders! We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period.\n\n20k backend development = 3,3k/month\n\n10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month\n\n5k web development = 800$/month\n\n15k marketing = 2.5k/month\n\n5k  Discord maintenance = 900$/month\n\n5k  Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners.

We both want to see an open-source alternative to Meta. We also know that there's a lot of work to be done to get there.\nThis proposal is our first step towards that vision.\n\n### Vision\nWe would love to see a thriving community of Decentraland game creators enabled by an ecosystem of tools that support them. Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.\nThe long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.\nTo achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.\n\n![Pixel art character concept art](https://d3da1k6uo8tbjf.cloudfront.net/edd84342-f714-11ec-8fd8-b2d1a80aa527?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22PixelArtCharacter%20Presentados.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27PixelArtCharacter%2520Presentados.png&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAS5PME4CT5QW2PJJU%2F20220628%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220628T204139Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c436f20009faf4e0ef686af1913333050cc54a4c078150cb4cc1c27a2f163974&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kM2RhMWs2dW84dGJqZi5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9lZGQ4NDM0Mi1mNzE0LTExZWMtOGZkOC1iMmQxYTgwYWE1Mjc~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_&Signature=qNUO6ENCDRXzJZGNR2al2iXX7u10HSsaaPB0N0mam-l~LmIUByjxSL5cNrViDmxLbAy32rTPJRYXUK44QR51puMUAvkl0C6DOUJGcCVJ7YH7H6nW-6HFxqgbTeuiVW0NESrBzP4i85kJovCeIa0E5dqeGcFndlG0STktmb07DeLANrPY25kcxxPlL7p7E6TwP8dA7ImMaSOL0LeA76Lq6MAwnSOlsPiaSBCIlZwbsHxzNxSjENh1MiyOGnAXKTodCuhSwhk-636A-HCk4PIaHrVplCbEjR6sioO65jYhtYubmwjHIbW36IoqlPCnyk7Z4gZq5BFa63YXvo7etyjREA__&Key-Pair-Id=K2BMZZDBFKKL41)","specification":"In order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.\n\nYou may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.\n\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700_3735892699868507_512428938455866077_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s640x640&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna&oh=00_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA&oe=62C136F0)\n\nThe main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:\n1. An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.\n2. A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).\n3. The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.\n4. A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.\n5. Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.\n\nWith these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.\n\nAs a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.\n\nOut of scope for this prototype:\n\n* Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).\n* Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.\n* Implementing a 2D sample game.","personnel":"**[frantufro](https://frantufro.com)** is a game and software developer with 20 years of experience and the owner and director of [Hidden People Club](https://hiddenpeople.club), a small game development team located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We will begin hosting live shows inside our Decentraland Social Hub once construction is complete in 3-6 months. POAPS are created and minted for each event.\n\n- We hold themed builder competitions once every two weeks with prizes of up to 5,000 SAND going to the winners (prize money funded by the Sandbox). The submissions and voting process are all broadcast live from our Twitch steam. \n\n- 28 builders on our platform have been offered contract- and full-time roles to create experiences and assets that can be used on Metaverse LAND. \n\n- The Sandstorm team has employed another 10 independent artists to help us fulfill projects for our partners.

With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning. For this version 4 players for a start should be enough.\nA player get near a table, click on it, gets a message in a window if he is able to join a game instance. Users are able to join during a certain phase of the game. If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.\n\nZero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K \nWhere M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.\nFirst phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.\nSecond phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.\nThen everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.\n\nIf a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.\n\nAfter the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.\n\nNew players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.\n\nIf within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThis project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.\nVoting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.\nWe plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene.","personnel":"We are M-social Production, web and web3 developers, we have been doing digital projects since 2008.\nThere will be 4 people engaged in development:\n - Frontend dev\n - Backend dev\n - QA specialist\n - Project manager\n\nIf you want to know more about our experience, you can visit our website: https://msocialproduction.com","roadmap":"We expect a working alpha to be done within 3 weeks.\nWithin 2 weeks, we plan to make the functional code.

This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.","abstract":"The question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.\n \nPreviously passed proposals include:\n- On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.     \n- On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:\n\n \nMythic: 1000 VP\n\nLegendary: 100 VP\t\n\nEpic: 10 VP\t\n\nRare: 5 VP\n\nUncommon: 1 VP\n\nThe argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.  \n\nThis proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.","motivation":"This proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway. \n\nWhile there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify. \n\nThe Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.","specification":"Attach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:\n\n1. Community Contest \n2. DCL Launch\n3. Exclusive Masks\n4. Halloween 2019\n5. MCH Collection\n6. Xmas 2019\n\n- There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.\n\nVP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:\n\n- Mythic: 1000 VP\n- Legendary: 100 VP\n- Epic: 10 VP\n- Rare: 5 VP\n- Uncommon: 1 VP\n\n- There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.\n\nIn total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]","impacts":"The underlying philosophy behind this proposal is that creating new VP and expanding participation in the DAO is inherently positive! Empowering various stakeholder groups makes our overall system more robust, and if anything, voter apathy is more of a risk than interest group consolidation of power - which this proposed pathway also mitigates by limiting the amount of VP that is being created as part of this process, by restricting it to particular L1 collections. \n\nThere is some concern, however, that restricting VP to the original six 2019 collections increasingly favors a particular sector of the Decentraland Community, that already has significant holdings when compared to newer entries into the ecosystem. One mitigation pathway would be to extend voting power to official L1 collections from 2020 as well; or as has been discussed previously, to apply VP to all L1 wearables, regardless of collection. These mechanisms are however not under consideration as part of this current proposal, and should this proposal fail, could be reconsidered by the Wearables VP Working Group.","implementation_pathways":"The Snapshot Voting Strategy for this proposal will be configured as follows:\n\n{\n  \"symbol\": \"WEARABLE\",\n  \"collections\": [\n    \"0x32b7495895264ac9d0b12d32afd435453458b1c6\",\n    \"0xd35147be6401dcb20811f2104c33de8e97ed6818\",\n    \"0xc04528c14c8ffd84c7c1fb6719b4a89853035cdd\",\n    \"0xc1f4b0eea2bd6690930e6c66efd3e197d620b9c2\",\n    \"0xf64dc33a192e056bb5f0e5049356a0498b502d50\",\n    \"0xc3af02c0fd486c8e9da5788b915d6fff3f049866\"\n  ],\n  \"multipliers\": {\n    \"mythic\": 1000,\n    \"legendary\": 100,\n    \"epic\": 10,\n    \"rare\": 5,\n    \"uncommon\": 1\n  }\n}\n\nA draft version of the strategy - which will be reviewed and can be implemented if this measure passes the binding governance proposal stage - can be found at the following link:\nhttps://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/606","conclusion":"These six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12698,"scores_total":6940498.803592637,"votes":72,"manaVP":4502724.754842784,"landVP":708000,"namesVP":248600,"delegatedVP":1481174.0487498539,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"96914860-f311-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d","snapshot_id":"QmQntSdVjqt4kiQMQJoS2oM6r1mmcjPJeSE9NLh6SFHwKW","user":"0xcf10cd8b5dc2323b1eb6de6164647756bad4de4d","type":"grant","title":"Golfcraft game and more projects by Eibriel, Pablo & co.","start_at":"2022-06-23T16:29:00.774Z","finish_at":"2022-07-07T16:29:00.772Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Golfcraft game and more projects by Eibriel, Pablo & co.","abstract":"**Golfcraft is a free-to-earn and build-to-earn game for Decentraland we have been working on in the last year and half.**\n\nOur vision is to empower the community to decide the market prices, minting NFTs at not cost and trading them on OpenSea.\n\nWe have different player types, some improving their game every day, others building golf courses or organizing tournaments; each of them being able to generate resources for themselves in a passive or active way.\n\nWhile creating Golfcraft we established OhMyVerse, a company dedicated to create experiences for the metaverse.\n\n**With the help of this grant our goal is to continue dedicating 100%  of our effort to improve Decentraland creating engaging content.**","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x0B2Ad22519013B7d119F3c3C26bb65E2A4596379","description":"Some time ago the DCL community trusted us with a [Tier 5 grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f7459b10-46e2-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5), after several months of hard work we are currently completing the last milestone: adding the golf course editor! \n\n**While building the game, the scene received a continuous traffic of users and we had some experiences to remember:**\n* A [course builder contest](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1522002489574408192) where our users had the opportunity to [express themselves](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1529770383422939137).\n* The launch of a new [Building designed by Polygonal Mind](https://twitter.com/GolfcraftGame/status/1510027642774433800) hosting a treasure hunt coordinated with different influencers and communities.\n* Intense competition events.\n* Collaborations with several community wearable designers: [Aeyon](https://twitter.com/SmilleAeyon), [Tobik](https://twitter.com/TobikCC), [SparkleStudios](https://twitter.com/studio_sparkles), [PolygonalMind](https://twitter.com/polygonalmind), [Doki](https://twitter.com/DokiDCL), [DuckiezKing](https://twitter.com/DuckiezKing).\n* A [12 week league](https://twitter.com/helpimstreaming/status/1508489190404771844) and other independent events driven by streamers like [helpimstreaming](https://twitter.com/helpimstreaming), [LucasCol](https://twitter.com/Lucascol_), [BobysBongZ](https://twitter.com/BobysBongZ) and their communities.\n\n\nIn the next quarter **our plan is to complete the most important pillar for Golfcraft: Crafting mechanics**.

Then the electricity consumed is evaluated in the different location. This energy calculation should include the end user device, the networking and the servers of the metaverse. \nOnce the energy is evaluated for each location (granularity of a country), a new NFT is created including the extract of all the related certificate based on the preferred energy type (e.g. wind, solar…).","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":49997,"beneficiary":"0x73c4914A6Ec3E450A52B90bd7fe73929ABC0241a","description":"The grant will be used for standardizing the current API of NRverse for Decentraland purpose. The ultimate goal would be to offer seamless \"Decentraland Green Option\" or DGO in Decentraland platform for running on green electricity any land, event or user experience. This will mean that each time the DGO is activated each related electricity consumption around the world will be backed by renewable energy. \nFor doing so we will need to adapt the modules of NRverse to Decentraland specific parameters, we talk about: the calculator and the tokenizer of Renewables Energy Certificate and finally the interface. \n\n1) Calculator: First, and most important, is to develop the proper calculator modules adapted to Decentraland reality. \n1.1) Evaluation of electricity consumption: The electricity consumption is coming from multiple source: the end user device, the networking, the server of Decentraland. \nFor each of these electricity consumption centers, 2 aspects must be evaluated: the location and the amount of electricity during a certain period. In that context the project will develop a specific calculator based on the data from each user (IP address, wallet information, browser...) but also based on Decentraland servers data. \n\n1.2) Listening to Decentraland through SDK: Then the calculator will need to interface with the current Decentraland SDK to evaluate specific land information (e.g. amount of users, wallet information, transaciton happening...)\n\n-> The result of this should evaluate in real time the worldwide consumption of electricity of the activity on the land (e.g. parcel 45,62 consuming during last hour 30kWh in Germany, 1300 MWh in US, 48 kWh in Brazil...). \n\n2) Renewables Energy Certificate tokenizer: afterwards the amount of energy that is calculated needs to be extracted from existing Green certificate and tokenized into one NFT. \n2.1) Tokenizer: We need to create the smart contract that will generate the NFT including all the extract from  the different guarantee of origin. \n2.2) Update REC mother contract: We need to implement the logic that will update the smart contract that is containing the different original Renewables Energy Certificate (these are tokenized initially from a PDF coming from trusted issuers all over the world). \n\n3) User Interface: Second the interface for proposing Decentraland decarbonization services will be built. It includes a portal for organizing event (for corporate for example), the renting of Land. This will include partnership with player like moonbash and MGHDAO.\n\nUltimately we should have on one side an API that could be offer to anybody that wants to integrate in its land automated decarbonization and on the other side a portal that can help any participant, land owner to initiate the decarbonization of a land (continuously) or a simple event. On top we could include this certification explicitly into some ticket that can take any form of collectible.","specification":"1) The first capability of the product has been developed (in beta): upload the pdf Renewables Energy Certificate and transform them into an NFT.\nIn that process, the PDF's (from the initial Renewable Energy Certificate - REC) are parsed and data are stored in IPFS, they are then signed via Verifiable Credential thanks to the wallet of the REC's supplier (here metamask). The interface is to upload the data is a simple webpage. The NFT is then generated and transferred tot he wallet of NRverse. \nThe current chain used is Ethereum testnet because VC's / DiD are not available on polygon yet but that could be derived easily based  open source code from EWF (https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry) which was used by the team in the past in other projects. There is a full documentation about the API and the process which could be put at disposal.\n\n2) We need now to create the calculator capability for Decentraland and the related activities. This module will be most likely developed in javascript and will start by the evaluation of ethereum transaction notably based on McDonald calculation (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-emissions/blob/main/input/extra_data_label_regex.json ). \nFor the first version of the calculator the use in Decentraland will be based on benchmark as: laptop/desktop consumption, server consumption and networking from similar game and well as studies. Some details of technology architecture from Decentraland (servers, databases...) would help to evaluate more accurately the energy consumption. \nFor accurate calculation of an event or activity on a land the SDK of Decentraland will be used. Some advanced functionalities as conditional access to a parcel will also be used for specific event organisation for example. Another important interface will be the marketplace as certificate could be integrated as metadata of NFT to incentivize the explicit choice of participating to an event based on renewable energy. \n\n3) The last capability to develop will be the tokenizer module that will aggregate the NFT containing all the extract of the Renewables Energy Certificates will be developed in Polygon. \nThe wallet to be used will as well be Metamask and the payment will be managed in Mana.","personnel":"The project will be elad by Kai & Loic co-founder of NRverse and by their partners from BloxMove, MGH DAO and Lineup.\n\nKai Schmied is engineer with 10 years of experience in energy including 4 years fo experience in managing blockchain project in the context of the energy sector.

We are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.​\n​\n\nWe propose creating a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL, which will help the DCL community to stand out on the metaverse platforms since this creation will be the first significant symbolic representation within the four major metaverse platforms. We believe that Web3.0 will enable the mascot to work even more functionally. The reasons are as follows.​\n​\n\nFirst and foremost, a DCL Mascot is a powerful marketing tool as it makes it easier for DCL to create a physical and emotional connection with every member. We think that because Web3.0 community members are from all over the world and in most cases, they don't have the opportunity to meet each other face to face, it has become harder for them to generate a sense of belonging. However, with the help of a mascot and more varied promo campaigns, DCL can easily bring the whole community together. For example, mascot costumes can be designed for members to wear in metaverse events, which will go a long way to making DCL members stand out and feel proud of their identities.​\n​\n\nWhat's more, the mascot will give DCL a competitive advantage on social media as followers are more likely to engage with the digital mascot. From Twitter pages to DCL experiences, a mascot can appear on various platforms. Mascot memes can also be created for DCL members to use on every platform.​\n​\n\nLast but not least, the DCL Mascot will be a memorable IP.​\n​\n\nThe BEAM Studio Team and any additional designers will work closely together to develop a first-of-its-kind Mascot with a unique personality, interactivity, and emotional support.","specification":"To begin this project, we will create a survey to collect DCL community members' opinions about the mascot and analyze the common traits within the community to decide on a mascot form that will perfectly represent the spiritual core of the community. This grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what they stand for.​\n​\n\nOne key part of this project is to design the virtual character of the mascot. We will use AI, C4D, AE, and other design tools to produce digital work. If it's a human or animal mascot, we will design its facial expressions, clothing, colour schemes, etc. If it's an object mascot, we will focus on how to convey the community spirits through this item with a combination of visuals and metaphors.​\n​\n\nBefore finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and colour schemes. We plan to design mascot-related memes and motions in the future and plan to release these memes and motions on our discord server. The avatars of the community administrators will all be replaced by mascots, and information about the mascot will be posted in the server's announcement. We promise that we will promote Mascot not only on our Discord server but also on our other official social media accounts, such as WeChat, Twitter, etc. Through our vigorous promotion, people will greatly increase their awareness of the mascot, and the image of DCL's mascot will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When people see the mascot, they will think that it represents DCL.​\n​\n\nFinally, the launch of the DCL Mascot could be coupled with a marketing project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes to Decentraland as possible with this mascot. This will bring the potential impact of DCL on the metaverse, with the aim of further encouraging the adoption of Decentraland, highlighting how it brings the community together and enables DCL users to fund projects that they have faith in.","personnel":"The proposed team of the Decentraland Mascot is the following:​\n\nMori:​\nCrypto artist, senior visual designer & freelance illustrator.

The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:\n- Metaverse journalism\n- Media DAOs\n- Decentralized tools for journalists\n- Token Funding\n- Token-gated content\n- Token incentives for collaborators\n\nThe plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics. Potential candidates are:\n\n- Laurent Bainier - [20mint.fr](https://20mint.xyz/) Web3 project from the french magazine 20minutes\n- KevinOnEarth - [Decentraland Report](https://xpand.gg/community/the-decentraland-report)\n- Reporters without borders - [Uncensored Library Project](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en) ([Grant funded](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) by Decentraland DAO)\n- [Tinshui Yeung](https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/tinshui-yeung) - ICFJ Fellow researching web3 journalism\n- Know someone who is doing cool stuff around web3, metaverses, and journalism? Let us know in the comments!\n\n\n### Why this event?\n\nHosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.\n\nSome of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.\n\n### Why the Decentraland DAO?\n\nLet's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.","specification":"The total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**\n\nBudget breakdown\n\n![budget-breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bmPZjUm.png)","personnel":"[Gino Cingolani](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani) (Decentraland DAO / Media Party)\nDecentraland Governance Squad Product Lead, Media Party Line-up Programmer. \n\n[Maggie Farley](https://twitter.com/maggilista) (ICFJ)  \nICFJ Director of Knight Fellowships.

Currently if you hold $MANA on the ethereum chain, you must first swap it to another currency to bridge on the Umbria platform.\n\nThe Umbria Narni Bridge uses a novel liquidity-provision protocol, to speed up, and lower the cost of cross-chain bridging. The bridge facilitates cross-chain migration of assets by holding multiple assets on multiple chains, simultaneously, in liquidity pools.  \n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge is different to other cross-chain bridges, because it does not rely on validator smart contracts, which can dramatically slow the bridging process. By removing the necessity for such validation, the Umbria Narni bridge can complete cross-chain transactions with an order of magnitude cheaper fees.\n\nwebsite: http://bridge.umbria.network\nUmbria offers bridging at a rate that is as much as 10x Cheaper and 10x Faster than other bridging platforms.

The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.","motivation":"The Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.\n\nEvery creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:\n\n* Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements. \n\n\n* Limit the cost of _perpetually_ hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.\n\n\n\n* Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.\n\n\n\nThe wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) \n\nThe proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.\n\nThe proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .\n\nSince then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.\n\nThis proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.","specification":"Below is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:\n\n* The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.\n\n* The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.\n\n* The fee should support the catalyst network.\n\n* The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.\n\n\nThe first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.\n\nRegarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.\n\nThe catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.\n\nThe cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**\n\nIn the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.\n\nAnd finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**\n\n**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**\n* 33% = 50 USD go to the curator\n* 10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers\n* 57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.","impacts":"This proposal will be beneficial to creators by derisking how they budget projects and promote their services, removing the volatility of MANA from the equation.\n\nThe proposed value of $150 USD per submitted wearable should be attractive to many talented creators while still preventing spam and supporting the underlying cost of running a wearables marketplace.\n\nA potential risk is to incentivize the submissions of low-quality wearables, making the curation process longer and rising the cost of running a catalyst. This could be mitigated by implementing more automation over the process curation process and/or raising the price in the future with a new governance process.","implementation_pathways":"Decentraland Foundation with the help of the Security Advisory Board will deploy the update of the marketplace's smart contracts to set the wearable submission to $150 USD payable in MANA.\n\nThe DAO Committee will issue payments to curators on monthly basis at a new rate of $50 USD per curation. The DAO Committee will propose a mechanism to distribute compensation to catalyst owners over time.","conclusion":"This proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.\n\nEconomics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12441,"scores_total":8144760.774489767,"votes":50,"manaVP":6237930.486850639,"landVP":316000,"namesVP":23100,"delegatedVP":1567730.2876391285,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"ce568980-e8c2-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac","snapshot_id":"QmQw8itQr3kQ3ksqAVbWejNgNY3cw8n1KLpuEjazqvLzNn","user":"0xeff9b702ae0f6f89cb0b3cfeab7c459520096e60","type":"linked_wearables","title":"Add POLYSTAR to the Linked Wearables Registry","start_at":"2022-06-10T13:39:00.472Z","finish_at":"2022-06-17T13:39:00.471Z","required_to_pass":4000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"POLYSTAR","links":["https://polystar.studio.site/"],"nft_collections":"A collection of toy figures with the goal of creating a colorful world.

The Decentraland wearable creation process currently has a steep learning curve for non-technical 3D artists who want to express themselves or facilitate a brand experience. 2D artists currently are completely dependent on 3D artists to be included into the ecosystem; an inadvertent gate set up by the current wearables submission paradigm.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, non-3D-proficient submissions often lead to delays in the curation process as multiple rounds of submissions and back-and-forth between the curation committee can occur before a final design is honed and approved. This excessive iteration could lead to delays for brand items to be ready for events on time, but also strains the wearable-curation committee as the submission fee does not account for the time the experts ultimately spend reviewing. \n\n### Solution:\n\nWear Essentials will provide a platform for aspiring wearables creators to design wearables without technical barriers. An easy to navigate user experience will allow creators to upload a 2D image and see their graphic presented on a catalog of essential wearables in real time. The solution will then manage the submission and curation process, deploy the wearables, and provide analytics with feedback about their uptake and distribution. \n\nUpon submission to the wearables committee - an action which will be available right in the platform - the whole process of deployment and royalty management can be handled. Through use of payment splitter contracts on polygon, an allocation of creator funds raised through primary and secondary sales can be shared with the DAO.\n\nThe collection of templates can also be expanded over time in partnership with brands and organizations.\n\nIt makes it easier for creators as the platform will provide a set of guardrails to produce quality wearables. A set of template wearables - hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes - provide a foundation to ensure the end result will have the correct poly-counts and vertex weighting. Creators can then upload 2D imagery to be mapped on the templates. Users only need to make choices on template color and placement/size of the 2D image content to result in a wearable ready for submission to the committee. This opens up the whole ecosystem to 2D artists (illustrators, graphic designers, tattoo and traditional). \n\nIt reduces the burden on the DAO Wearables Committee as submissions coming direct from the platform have less for the team to review. Confident that the poly-counts and assets are templated, the focus can then be placed on the guidelines for the 2D images that users uploaded (approved content, IP-infringement issues, etc…). \n\nIt will increase revenue to the DAO in a few ways. Through the simplification of the wearables submission process, this platform may lead to an increase in submissions to the DAO. In addition, payment splitters or similar payment rails can be put in place to enforce revenue sharing of primary and secondary sales revenue directly with the DAO. Note that while the purpose of this initiative is to primarily build engagement and increase participation in the wearable creation process, we believe it does not hurt to add additional subsidies back to the DAO where possible.\n\nOnce the application is public we will release opensource to the community with a well documented guide!","specification":"Here is a graphical [pitch deck](https://indd.adobe.com/view/9cbd17ae-f9ec-4b4e-8e13-4619d2e8ad9f).  \n*Discrepancy regarding the submission price in the pitch deck, this has now changed due to recent proposals*\n\nHere is an early mock up provided by our designer.

Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)","motivation":"In the past year,  [one committee member has sent +500 transactions](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**","specification":"Establish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.\n\nEach committee member will commit to working 10hrs per week at a rate of 60 USD/hr.","impacts":"Setting compensation to the DAO Committee will attract and retain members with the required know-how to take such a responsibility. Having a strong DAO Committee will ensure the timely operations of the DAO.\n\nThis proposal specifies a fixed compensation per month regardless of the activity of the committee member. This might be a risk for a committee with many members, where the work of verifying transactions is done by a sub-set of the group. At the moment the committee only has 2 members and this is not a problem, but it would be interesting to transition to a performance-based compensation in the future (e.g. based on the number of transactions initiated and signed by the member).","implementation_pathways":"The DAO Committee already has control of the DAO Treasury and is responsible for making payments to the Curators Committee and funding Grants voted by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO Committee will issue the compensation to itself at the beginning of every month by sending 2,400 USD worth of MANA (using the current market price).","conclusion":"Over the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.\n\nSetting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12324,"scores_total":5162191.849278394,"votes":29,"manaVP":1715977.6674822154,"landVP":2554000,"namesVP":4800,"delegatedVP":887414.1817961783,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"a371ead0-e5a1-11ec-9a81-b1d70acf7d8d","snapshot_id":"QmSRMaxowBm5HbaSUKuDwqs7Bi7Q53MhCPXPd8x55E3h53","user":"0xc70650c50487853ed6ff692945cd05a446a95536","type":"poll","title":"Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?","start_at":"2022-06-06T14:04:00.629Z","finish_at":"2022-06-11T14:04:00.627Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?","description":"We propose that Decentraland scenes also become NFTs so that creators can monetise their work and also be rewarded for it. \n\nThe ultimate question this poll is trying to answer is: Who is building the Open Metaverse? \n \nThe current representation of the Metaverse remains empty. Stakeholders want to embrace the Metaverse, but they are faced with vast plots of land that remain empty. In addition, not every landowner can afford to purchase bespoke designs. \n\nTo keep users entertained, the Metaverse requires a lot of content. Virtual amusement parks, concerts, casinos, movie theaters, conferences, universities, etc. The Metaverse is a new area full of possibilities for architects/designers, as well as a new realm free of the limits of the physical world. This is evident in a lot of Decentraland building designs. For consumers who wish to gather one-of-a-kind assets, architects/designers can construct unique designs supported by NFT technology. Architects/designers can create digital assets such as cities, buildings, furniture, sculptures, point clouds, textures, and so on, and sell them to virtual worlds many times.\n\nArchitects/designers can now become content producers, leveraging their efforts for exponential development through Decentraland, similarly to how the marketplace works currently for land and wearables, while at the same time reaching out to potential consumers with excellent material, keeping them engaged, and growing Decentraland’s user base.\n\nAs a result, we'd want to pose the question to the current users of Decentraland and ask if scenes should also be NFTs, allowing architects who are now content creators to directly profit from the Decentraland Marketplace but also make them willing to sell their designs and embrace the platform.

The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.","motivation":"Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver. \n\nICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.\n\nIn addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more. \n\nThe stats today:\n- 12 live Decentraland venues\n- 1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n- 8,000+ daily active players\n- 203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)","specification":"Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens. \n\n### Details:\n- Within 10 days following the final binding proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the ICE-USDC LP.\n- MANA will be distributed by smart contract, available claim in proportion to the amount of LP staked and the amount of time that LP is staked. \n- 0 MANA will be earned/retained by the DG DAO Treasury and DG Team. Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.","impacts":"Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space: The competition is spending on development and promises eventual users; DCL has users. \n\nThis proposal will support the ICE price and thereby maintain DCL DAU while SNGs ramp up, but this describes only half the equation and represents the small upside to DCL. In the true \"upside scenario,\" SNG closes the remaining gap toward making the ICE economics sustainable, and the ICE Poker ecosystem succeeds in onboarding millions of players into Decentraland. Half of the gap to sustainability has already been closed, and, in short, the proposal helps bridge the remainder across 3 months, reversing DCL's DAU decline in the short term and facilitates returning to growth sooner. The \"downside scenario\" is that SNG does not succeed in spite of substantial progress made to-date and this proposal only serves to sustain DCL DAU while rewards are deployed.\n\nThe mechanics of of LP rewards sustain the ICE price are straightforward: Rewarding the ICE-USDC LP pool (while excluding the DG DAO LP from being rewarded) will generate incremental demand for ICE. It's challenging to predict the exact amount of this demand in advance; this would cause a significant amount of ICE to be taken out of circulation and placed in the pool; as a result, the ICE price will be supported while SNG is releases and ramps up.","implementation_pathways":"As outlined in the 'Specification' section, the only required step for implementation by the DCL DAO itself will be for the DCL DAO to transfer $1M MANA to dgtreasury.eth. The DG Team will deploy on Polygon their audited LP rewards smart contract that was previously used to reward the ETH-DG LP pool and apply this reward ICE-USDC LP on QuickSwap. MANA Rewards will be distributed to those who stake these LP tokens as outlined in the 'Specification' section and a UI will be provided on https://decentral.games/dg/liquidity.","conclusion":"Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. \n\n**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. \n\nICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable. \n\nSince the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO. \n\n**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.\n\n**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**\n\n$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards. \n\n**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.\n\n**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**\n\n\"We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.\"","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12243,"scores_total":11115808.144226275,"votes":191,"manaVP":2673050.2717336603,"landVP":7010000,"namesVP":116100,"delegatedVP":1316657.8724926126,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"8e935300-e255-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935","snapshot_id":"QmYQHcRBrNeGRV4ZQ5WQU3ftzYzWPZ11paRXijLcGhw83B","user":"0xbb54a5ea7100bc3f39cf1929c1881b45d98d4c92","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name julie","start_at":"2022-06-02T09:22:00.376Z","finish_at":"2022-06-09T09:22:00.374Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"julie","description":"good,i have no idea about it","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12228,"scores_total":1939471.3288707368,"votes":33,"manaVP":35517.23233539516,"landVP":238000,"namesVP":165800,"delegatedVP":1500154.096535341,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"128084f0-e1dc-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935","snapshot_id":"QmUe6WQJZDqfTZMWMA2iS42Q8iepHEf5mCQAR1boaCoi65","user":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","type":"draft","title":"Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees","start_at":"2022-06-01T18:53:00.111Z","finish_at":"2022-06-08T18:53:00.108Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"e1fcd600-d7a2-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","title":"Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees","summary":"Set the wearable submission to $150 USD worth of MANA and set the curators compensation to $50 USD per item reviewed.","abstract":"This proposal aims to align the DCL community about how the wearable submission fee should be structured. The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.","motivation":"The Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.\n\nEvery creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:\n\n* Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements. \n\n\n* Limit the cost of _perpetually_ hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.\n\n\n\n* Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.\n\n\n\nThe wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) \n\nThe proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.\n\nThe proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .\n\nSince then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.\n\nThis proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.","specification":"Below is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:\n\n* The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.\n\n* The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.\n\n* The fee should support the catalyst network.\n\n* The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.\n\n\nThe first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.\n\nRegarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.\n\nThe catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.\n\nThe cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**\n\nIn the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.\n\nAnd finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**\n\n**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**\n* 33% = 50 USD go to the curator\n* 10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers\n* 57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.","conclusion":"This proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.\n\nEconomics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12213,"scores_total":2576584.566131162,"votes":67,"manaVP":512582.987379867,"landVP":604000,"namesVP":26700,"delegatedVP":1433301.5787512953,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"2c9d9ae0-e1d6-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935","snapshot_id":"QmNoZf863d2kJdz95s28hogUawo6hyxNnmeTxCmLeWJ3ZY","user":"0x2d779a930567f54899336c3f7f2dbaf804a25c78","type":"grant","title":"Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Experience","start_at":"2022-06-01T18:10:00.942Z","finish_at":"2022-06-15T18:10:00.942Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Experience","abstract":"Create an interactive immersive VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction within Decentraland.","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":160000,"beneficiary":"0x49c54146FC13b0229942b37fEE4Bf316aD6E9953","description":"I, Kirk Gonzales, the CEO of Animation Studio Lightspeed Graphics, LLC (lightspeedgfx.com) is requesting a grant of $160,000 to build a Metaverse Ride Simulator Attraction experience within Decentraland. \n\nLightspeed Graphics is an Animation studio from California producing 2D Motion Graphics, 3D Animation, AR/VR, Game Design and Visual Effects. Lightspeed Graphics was launched in 2017 to create multimedia digital video experiences, commercial advertising, and graphic design, and would like to be the first to develop a new and exciting animated attraction within Decentraland.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics team believes in the need to bring Virtual Reality and storytelling as a truly rewarding and engaging experience to face challenges like user adoption, market size capture, and player satisfaction or retention among many other determinants. The VR industry will become more prevalent and interconnected to metaverse web3 applications as we reach mass adoption in the coming years and as new projects make their own unique metaverse-like experience. \n\nThe idea was inspired by the classic Ride Simulator Attractions seen at amusement parks, exhibits or tech museums that have been enjoyed for generations. We believe bringing this ride simulator experience into the metaverse will help bring value to Decentraland and help transition real world attractions or experiences into a connected metaverse experience.\n\nVeteran players and new players from AR/VR users, gamers, developers, film industry specialists, MX specialists and quite possibly well-known companies like Dynamic Attractions are all part of the target audience as we carve a space for VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attractions.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics Team and any additional contractors will work closely together to develop a first of its kind Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction with a complete narrative storyline, interactivity and future multiplayer experience.","specification":"The VR/Desktop Ride simulator will be accessible to the public and be distinguishable by the ‘Jump 2 Lightspeed’ logo. The size will need to be at least a 3x3 estate. The first adventure will be completely free to the public to ride indefinitely and be a learning experience for returning and new users to Decentraland. A crafting system will guide players to create unique wearables, in-game items and trade systems. Later, story add-ons called ‘Arcs’ will be gated by an initial purchase of an NFT, tickets, or subscription.\n\nOnce the Player has been granted access and has clicked the Ride Simulator, they are transported to a fixed chair position with the user’s perspective locked to the view of their avatar, while other avatars can be seen filling empty chair slots, (multiplayer experience), as the ride makes its final countdown to launch. Sponsored videos (will play during the countdown process to and promote other adventures, events, and activities throughout DCL.\n\nOnce the countdown has completed, no other players can join that adventure instance at this point. The lights dim and the animated adventure on screen begins playing.\nThe user has the option to enter fullscreen and see the entire video experience with a full monitor takeover, while the Oculus Headset user is now able to do a full headset takeover. \nThe game itself will feel like a rollercoaster ride through space, complete with narrative, voice over performances. Future development will bring the ability to fire and aim at targets with the mouse or Oculus controllers, making it a complete interactive game.","personnel":"Lightspeed Graphics:\nKirk Gonzales (CEO / Lead Designer)\nTwitter Handle: @AnmtrKirk\nLinkedin: linkedin.com/in/kirkgonzales\n\nAbout Me: I attended college for a B.A. from 2007 to 2011 in film and video production to learn everything needed behind movies, visual journalism and music videos.

I am proposing a more balanced Voting Power allocation, should the methods of the proposed allocations be feasible and amendable.\n\nPreserving a near relative Voting Power for current leading voters is essential to gain support on getting a more balanced voting system approved and implemented. This proposal conserves the Voting Power of leading voters and adds additional voting power through creative balancing while preventing material dilution.\n\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThere is an imbalance of Voting Power favoring those with large amounts of MANA or LAND creating a perceived class war. Understanding that MANA and LAND are investments in DCL, they deserve fair Voting Power but no one DCL contribution asset should overshadow the community as a whole. All stakeholders should have an equitable say.\n\n**Current:**\n- 1 MANA contributes 1 VP\n- 1 NAME contributes 100 VP\n- 1 LAND parcel contributes 2000 VP\n- Each Estate is worth 2000 multiplied by the number of single LAND parcels in that Estate. For example, an Estate with 2 parcels will contribute 4000 VP to your total voting power.\n\n**In the Works:**\n- Some L1 wearables will get additional VP based on proposal \"Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections\".\n\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nBy adding additional voting rights through new allocations using relative contribution and vested interest factors, it disperses the Voting Power across the community in a more equitable way.\n\n**Proposed Additions:**\nIn addition to current Voting Power allocation…\n- 1 MANA spent in DCL contributes 1.5 VP (new)\n- 1 WEARABLES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)\n- 1 EMOTES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)\n- ACTIVE DAYS in Decentraland contributes = 1 VP per day (new)\n- DOB of Decentraland Character = 0.5 VP per day (new)\n\n\nNAME and LAND owners would be getting a small inherent multiplier for both spending MANA and having their respective Decentraland assets. An additional inherent multiplier is the MANA from LAND proceeds, such as renting, that the asset owner continues to hold in their DCL connected wallet.\n\nWEARABLE CREATORS would be getting a inherent multiplier for both spending MANA (in DCL) and being a content creator for DCL. An additional multiplier is the MANA proceeds from wearable sales that continue to be held in their DCL connected wallet.\n\nThese are reasonable inherent multipliers that give greater weight to those that have long term horizons on the success of DCL. These investments are not as easy to divest giving them more incentive for long term growth of Decentraland.\n\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThis proposal for balancing Voting Power in Decentraland gives investors, creators, & consumers more equitable voting power allowing for the voices and opinions of the community to be heard. This creates a vested interest in the betterment of Decentraland and ultimately more engagement. This promotes investments that create stickiness to DCL which increases the value of past contributions (investments) in DCL. Some of the additional Voting Power also promotes spending in Decentraland which gives the DAO more revenue to service DCL.\n\nI would expect future proposals for re-balancing as the community and its contributing members grow, however the members choose to contribute.","choices":["Add New VP Allocations","Leave VP As Is","Abstain","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":12149,"scores_total":1551670.626272409,"votes":34,"manaVP":10197.370960288079,"landVP":258000,"namesVP":84700,"delegatedVP":1198773.2553121205,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"112fdf40-dffe-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993","snapshot_id":"QmUuoXNVwhmNFDgdw85XdcP1VfetXdaX4zjFMd3fmCTqo7","user":"0xaf0e126d11161fd002200e980103b78470e660e4","type":"draft","title":"Add district names to decentraland map.","start_at":"2022-05-30T09:51:00.468Z","finish_at":"2022-06-06T09:51:00.467Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"f1342cd0-d2fd-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","title":"Add district names to decentraland map.","summary":"Add district names to decentraland map","abstract":"Identify the distrincts in the decentraland map","motivation":"Since I entered decentraland for the first time, and today in my day to day life, I see these huge masses of blue land and I never know which district is which.\n\nI see no point in not having your name on the map!","specification":"The dao should add the district names in a different style than the point of interest.","conclusion":"Add district names to decentraland map to identify them.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12145,"scores_total":1538951.795387557,"votes":33,"manaVP":227028.7870958976,"landVP":442000,"namesVP":87300,"delegatedVP":782623.0082916592,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"652553c0-defd-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993","snapshot_id":"QmXWLkkMkoYeDBwydCX4k5PGPfKacAmbte2quph5FkHPM7","user":"0xcd4fec10c8ad4873e209062b31defb684ff8cb7c","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 129,19 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-05-29T03:14:00.668Z","finish_at":"2022-06-05T03:14:00.667Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":129,"y":19,"type":"add_poi","description":"Would like to add 129,19 to Points of Interest","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":12129,"scores_total":419520.75046883913,"votes":18,"manaVP":5767.231954952571,"landVP":120000,"namesVP":3300,"delegatedVP":290453.5185138866,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"a8c393f0-defb-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993","snapshot_id":"Qmbv1mbCc6FGLgQ3wLiYGCJr6aiVCFiFa9ePhDNtfJXS76","user":"0x60206b4b0eeefed1c5fb8f755527f72fa872b143","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 7,-35 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-05-29T03:01:00.119Z","finish_at":"2022-06-05T03:01:00.119Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":7,"y":-35,"type":"add_poi","description":"Hey Decentraland Community!

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND! That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL. \nThe 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)\n- 1.5k per month for marketing \n- 2.5k per month for development","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.

Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop.

Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.","motivation":"Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver. \n\nICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.\n\nIn addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more. \n\nThe stats today:\n- 12 live Decentraland venues\n- 1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n- 8,000+ daily active players\n- 203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)","specification":"Allocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap.

Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.","conclusion":"Daily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. \n\n**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. \n\nICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable. \n\nSince the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO. \n\n**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.\n\n**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**\n\n$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards. \n\n**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.\n\n**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**\n\n\"We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability.

This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.","abstract":"The question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.\n \nPreviously passed proposals include:\n- On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.     \n- On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:\n\n \nMythic: 1000 VP\n\nLegendary: 100 VP\t\n\nEpic: 10 VP\t\n\nRare: 5 VP\n\nUncommon: 1 VP\n\nThe argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.  \n\nThis proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.","motivation":"This proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway. \n\nWhile there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify. \n\nThe Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.","specification":"Attach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019.

Xmas 2019\n\n- There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.\n\nVP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:\n\n- Mythic: 1000 VP\n- Legendary: 100 VP\n- Epic: 10 VP\n- Rare: 5 VP\n- Uncommon: 1 VP\n\n- There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.\n\nIn total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]","conclusion":"These six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11669,"scores_total":2831429.9773299783,"votes":54,"manaVP":601528.1552918691,"landVP":596000,"namesVP":175100,"delegatedVP":1458801.8220381103,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"ece9b3e0-d7c9-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"QmVCfrGX892iaDLkp5dBNJRa93U2DVbg3JNcD14mfGvMS1","user":"0x521b0fef9cdcf250abaf8e7bc798cbe13fa98692","type":"poll","title":"MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP on QuickSwap","start_at":"2022-05-19T23:18:00.478Z","finish_at":"2022-05-24T23:18:00.477Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP on QuickSwap","description":"Decentral Games ICE Poker is the first metaverse-native poker game. ICE Poker is a free play-and-earn poker game that gives players economic freedom through self-custody and delegation of wearables.\n\nIn addition to poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more. DG has experienced significant growth since launching ICE Poker in fall 2021 and have onboard thousands of people into Decentraland.\n\nDecentral Games is continuing to grow the ecosystem by launching competitive tournaments and metaverse advertising in our venues. We’re targeting July to launch sit-and-go tournaments which will increase product stickiness and improve our scaling to onboard the next larger wave of users into Decentraland. The stats today:\n\n - 12 live Decentraland venues\n - 1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n - 8,000+ daily active players\n - 40,000+ weekly visitors across all venues\n\nAll told, Decentral Games Venue visitors and ICE Poker players account for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users!\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nAssign $1M USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP bootstrap the pool. This is temporary (3-month) support while sit-and-go tournaments are developed, launch (July), and ramp up.\n\nNote 1: If the final proposal passes, within 10 days following the proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the LP, but no MANA would be retained/kept by the DG DAO. Specifically, 0 MANA will be assigned to the LP that the DG DAO itself provides to the pool (DG DAO won't stake LP), so all rewards will go to these Decentraland community members staking LP.\n\nNote 2: While this request would exceed the grant threshold, these are liquidity incentives for an LP pool on QuickSwap rather than a grant to the DG DAO (which would earn 0 MANA). \n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe DCL DAO assigning  MANA to bolster ICE-USDC liquidity (& $ICE price) would contribute to maintaining Decentraland's DAU. As mentioned in the proposal section, this would be temporary support for the pool (3 months).\n\nMoreover, most ICE holders are not MANA holders and this would help correct for the imbalance that most users of Decentraland today are Decentral Games event participants and ICE Poker players that do not hold MANA; namely, this would be an avenue to welcome them into the DCL DAO as well.\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution rather than Decentraland.\n\n(Submitted on behalf of DecentralGames)","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":11653,"scores_total":8003373.699499871,"votes":161,"manaVP":1262677.6602156106,"landVP":4818000,"namesVP":204500,"delegatedVP":1718196.0392842586,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"e1fcd600-d7a2-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"QmQFdipCdKfdnKPsHR4LM5rmZXcWxY5k5vzRhoLBS2bXHB","user":"0x3498857bb3e1cc8a3c9b582dc726f47a9625242b","type":"poll","title":"Halt the implementation of the Governance Proposal to adjust the creators fee to reflect a set fiat value of $500","start_at":"2022-05-19T18:38:00.776Z","finish_at":"2022-05-24T18:38:00.776Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Halt the implementation of the Governance Proposal to adjust the creators fee to reflect a set fiat value of $500","description":"It was announced today that DCL will be changing the creators fee from 100 Mana to $500 USD worth of Mana.

However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.\n\nUnder the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience. \n\n### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest\nThe team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses. \n\n### Continued development of Decentraland VR\nDecentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.\n\nThe team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"### Decentraland Native Quest Support. \n\nThe team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.\n\n\n### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements. \n\nAs mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR.","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/","roadmap":"### Progress Updates\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum and DAO Discord channel closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera. \n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.\n\nThe way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**","specification":"Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth. \n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp. \n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nNote that to avoid potential attacks or abuse situations where the gas tank could be emptied, claiming/buying wearables for free or less than 1 MANA is not going to be covered by the meta-transactions model.","impacts":"This will impact the whole Decentraland users","implementation_pathways":"The DAO will need to fund the Biconomy Gas Tank","conclusion":"If this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11551,"scores_total":6019732.860035107,"votes":45,"manaVP":1909750.4813080535,"landVP":2514000,"namesVP":8500,"delegatedVP":1587482.3787270538,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"28cb8be0-d4ff-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"Qme6tv5nWfjzGQcy7Gowpd5NrED7huPhRq1pXbH634rrha","user":"0x7fef2e929fb5598d0419f4301442064cbfaf1cdb","type":"poi","title":"Remove the location -43,-97 from the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-05-16T10:01:00.782Z","finish_at":"2022-05-23T10:01:00.782Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":-43,"y":-97,"type":"remove_poi","description":"The scene located at -43,-97, is requested to be removed from POI.

Our COO is Noah Jacobson who is a trained lawyer and operational leader. We've built our mobile app and just launched it this year in the Play and App stores and are gaining traction.  \nSkillProfile lets people create profiles made up of Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and then request anonymous feedback from their friends and colleagues and see the aggregate rating and comments. \nIt's like a 360 review but controlled by the individual and not limited to traditional employment or executives. It democratizes HR and Talent practices and puts it in the hands and control of the people themselves. It can also be extended to non-traditional employment and even game profiles (are you a good teammate, do you tilt under pressure, etc). \n\nWe would like to bring Skillprofile to the metaverse by creating a skills-based game and allows people to own their own profiles and then develop a place where people can share those profiles with others and expand the way we communicate and find employment or other like minded individuals in the metaverse.\n\nOur second phase would include the build out of a job board where users can share their SkillProfiles and potential employers or teammates can identify individuals who might be good candidates to either participate in their games, act as hosts, or do other necessary tasks to maintain the metaverse. Of course as Decentraland develops the way in which people interact could evolve in new and exciting ways so I hesitate to call it traditional employment but more like a place people can learn about themselves, develop their attributes and use them to create a life and experience they want.\nI believe we can create a place where what you bring to the table is verified, owned and is uniquely the individual and where others can find those people.","specification":"SkillProfile the app is already live in the Google Play store and the Apple App store and can be downloaded. It is fully functional, built on React Native uses a Google Cloud Platform back end based on Firebase. We would be extending the SkillProfile to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and to be able to be shared with others in Decentraland. We will also be creating an interactive experience or game to engage new users to claim theirs and start gathering feedback from people they interact with both in game and out.\nWith the grant we would purchase some land in Decentraland to create our scene and will be using Unity to develop an in world game/destination where participants can play, learn about skills. We have not fully fleshed out the game mechanics yet but we know it will relate to Knowlege Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and will help users flesh out their own personal Skillprofiles.

Every day, MMORPGs bring together millions of people who form strong bonds, communities, and entire economies. Out of a shared passion with cryptocurrencies and MMORPGs, Exodus was born with the goal of making these communities and economies into real, consensus driven assets.\n\nThe name Exodus symbolizes a journey away from the online games we played and cherished as children and towards a new era where crypto assets allow gamers to create real value out of their playtime. We believe that time spent gaming is valuable and want Exodus to realize that belief. Exodus is themed around the concept of moving on from old ways of life and towards a better and more prosperous future. The character will begin in the medieval period and discover new resources, materials, tools, creatures, and questlines. Players will be able to play either passively or actively and work towards special items which will be represented as on-chain assets. The ultimate vision of Exodus is to have a full-fledged blockchain economy capable of providing opportunities to players of all types.\n\nThe JTV team has always focused on educational outreach when onboarding new users. As such, it has grown out of a mutual love for learning and having fun at the same time. The team has volunteered countless hours towards providing Decentraland content and will continue to grow to expand this outreach. JTV embodies this vision and has become a true goodwill of the Decentraland space. With Exodus, the JTV Development team aims to bring thousands of people to Decentraland to have engaging metaverse experiences.","specification":"Team & Experience:\n\nJTV Development is led by none other than JTV, a prominent Decentraland streamer and influencer. JTV streams multiple times a week to onboard new users and share his metaverse experience. Through his promotions and community events, he has distributed tens of thousands of wearables and provided a ‘first wearable’ to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people. JTV has inspired many Decentraland content creators through his goodwill and general want to better himself and his community. In the opinion of the grant writer (not JTV) – JTV deserves the entirety of this grant, though his intention is to support his team and community through the massive task of building Exodus.\n\nThe JTV Engineers include 3 professional software engineers, 1 software intern, and 4 professional designers/artists. This group provides experience in blockchain development, backend engineering, front-end user experience, 3D designs/animations, web-design, and story-writing. If there was a team with the dedication to achieve the vision of Exodus, this is that team. In fact, the team has already volunteered their time towards creating engaging content like the popular JTV Easter egg hunt and scavenger hunts. Despite this grant’s pending status, the team has eagerly begun full-stack development of Exodus.\n\nAs the Exodus project grows, the JTV team intends to provide new metaverse opportunities to design and software interns. We believe that this fits well with the teams focus on educational content and its theme of giving back to the community. This fits well with the mission of Decentraland to empower its players and to provide opportunities to those who seek them.\n\nRevenue sources:\n\nMemberships\n\nAd space \n\nCosmetic NFTs\n\nBackend services","personnel":"Socials:\n\ntwitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nTwitter @JTV____\n\ndiscord.gg/jtv\n\nSite for beta signups. Our main site is currently under development.\nexodusgbw.io\n\nThe JTV Development team consists of 4 Engineers, 4 Designers and various volunteers. We intend to add multiple interns (at least 5 interns split between Engineering and Design) to add to this team.\n\nAllocation of Funds:\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering, Design, Marketing, and miscellaneous expenses like music, story writing, and server upkeep. Please understand, these values are approximate and may change depending on need. Engineering and design will include funds purposed towards hiring interns. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts: \n\nEngineering - $125,000 \n\nDesign – $75,000 \n\nMarketing - $25,000 \n\nMiscellaneous - $15,000","roadmap":"The primary release of Exodus will occur over a 6-month period with 3 phases: pre-beta, public-beta, and public release. The pre-beta phase will consist of a gradual release of gathering and crafting activities (woodchopping, fishing, mining, forging, cooking, scavenging), quests, and monster-hunting activities. Once fully rolled out, Exodus will transition into a public-beta purposed towards testing the game and preparing for public launch. Exodus intends to officially launch in January 2023.\n\nWe emphasize, the true roadmap of Exodus extends much further than the 6-month period of this grant. Our team intends to deliver a return of value to Decentraland for the long-term future. After public release, Exodus will continue to focus on attracting new players to Decentraland and building fresh content. Blockchain integration like wearables will be key features of Exodus, and will be continually developed for the game.\n\nWe believe that all grant recipients should strive to return the value of their grant plus some.

Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. \n\nMAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking. \n\nWe believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.\n\n### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant? \n\nCurrently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.\n\n### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community\n#### Landowners Community\n\n MAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \\MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board. \n\n#### Builders\n\n Decentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there’s a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.\n#### General Community\n\n MAD’s Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space.

Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera. \n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.\n\nThe way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**","specification":"Up until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth. \n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp. \n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace.

This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.","abstract":"The DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:\n\n- When a committee member resigns\n- When the community wants to replace a committee member\n- When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency\n\nThere are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:\n\n- Decisions must be as decentralized as possible\n-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee\n- Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together\n-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency\n\nBearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.","motivation":"**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.","specification":"**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1. **By the DAO Committee:**\n- Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n- After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n- Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n- DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2. **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n- The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\nAfter 24 hours, the member is removed\n- 3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n- In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n- Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n- If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3. **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n- The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    - The name of the committee member to remove\n    - Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n- To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP. \n- The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\nIn the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n1. If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2. If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n- In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n- The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.\n- The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.\n- The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications","impacts":"This proposal will enable multiple pathways for DAO Committee Members to be removed, resign, and be elected to the committee. It also creates legitimate pathways for rapid response by the Security Advisory Board (SAB) and other DAO Committee members in an emergency situation.Up to this time, there has been no formal pathway for the removal or appointment of new committee members.","implementation_pathways":"At this time, there is one DAO Committee spot open. Following approval of this proposal, the DAO committee will release an open call for DAO Committee Member Applicants, and follow the process outlined in the conclusion section below. Additionally, the DAO Committee will coordinate with the SAB to modify necessary Parameters via the DAO's Aragon infrastructure.","conclusion":"**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n1. What is your full name?\n2. What is your primary wallet address?\n3. Why are you applying?\n4. What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?\n5. What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6. Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7. Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8. Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.   \n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process. \n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11205,"scores_total":6654574.427703811,"votes":30,"manaVP":5099505.976049724,"landVP":516000,"namesVP":20800,"delegatedVP":1018268.4516540876,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"d22828a0-ca7e-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1","snapshot_id":"QmcK4CdWjTw1HXq6wQCGv8NoCmkwufq3JJkEyT3HMCwhgM","user":"0xae8bf49b1f8d56061bc693b7841c785b8e903ec5","type":"poll","title":"Adding VP for Wearable Creations DCL","start_at":"2022-05-03T01:17:00.218Z","finish_at":"2022-05-08T01:17:00.218Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Adding VP for Wearable Creations DCL","description":"\"This was idea was featured in an earlier poll of mine, and it caught a lot of traction. I would love to hear the community's response.\"\n\nHello, I am not the first to think of this proposal. However, I wanted to be the voice of the community. As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people. For example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse? For those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system for giving creators of wearables VP\n\nCreation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create.

However, I wanted to be the voice of the community. As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people.\nFor example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse?\nFor those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system to add more VP into the game, and more ways to accrue such points.\n\n1. Accrual of VP based on time spent in DCL In-game. This can be done by counting activity spent in the Metaverse as a time translation to VP. For example, what if you logged into DCL, and were active either by participating in activities, social experiences, ICE Poker, and others etc. Whether it's a certain allotted amount of time, or maybe days this seems like a fair exchange of governance say for those involved.\n\n2. Creation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create. It's smaller than the names, but you have a chance to make mana off of sales, so this seems like a fair trade.\n\n3. Participation in Governance Voting. Those who vote, regardless of their VP, should be able to reach a threshold of earning VP, for helping out the governance body. This would encourage a more diverse opinion of many in DCL, and hopefully increase participation on the DAO.\n\nThese are 3 such ways we can help to improve our governance system, and the future of Decentraland in general!

One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n- **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n- The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n- **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n- **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n- One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n- The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n- **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n- **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    - Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    - Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\nSure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n- We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL. \nSharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n- Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n- All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n- Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n- Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n- Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n- PvC mode improvements.\n- New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n- We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n- Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.","specification":"Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n\n- **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\nWe plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n\n- **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n\n- **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n\n- **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n\n- **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n\n- **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\nAnd combine these games into one unified economy.\nI am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.","personnel":"-   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago).

Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough.\nOur chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions.\nIn addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it.\nAs our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND!\nThat’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now.\nAll previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.\nSide note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.\nWhile we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.\nAlthough we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap! \n\nWe have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision… Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k). The remaining $35k that we are requesting will be used to hire on additional design and development support staff so that we can ensure that all promised content will be delivered in a timely manner.","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries.\nOur designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D.\nDue to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner.\nBasically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can claim and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.\nTo check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)\n\n(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken.

Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:\n\n- Decentraland Foundation-maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).\n- DAO-maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.\n\n### Problem\n\nThis **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership of the project** since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.\n\n\n### Potential Solutions\nThere are a couple of solutions we could implement if we want to unify both lists:\n\n- We could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**\n\n- We could also delete the Legacy POI List and let the community re-add the POIs that are still relevant (Genesis Plaza for example!) to the DAO-maintained list. To minimize the risk of losing an important POI, before the deletion of the Legacy list we could have a discussion on Discord and the Forum about the relevant POIs that we absolutely need to migrate so we can start creating proposals right after the Legacy list has been deleted.\n\n[Legacy POI List](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) -  See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names\n\nThis pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.","choices":["Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list","Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs","No, maintain both lists","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":11010,"scores_total":3146938.9356223317,"votes":16,"manaVP":49289.31604855519,"landVP":1680000,"namesVP":11900,"delegatedVP":1405749.6195737764,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"f26d0d80-c400-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4","snapshot_id":"QmZyogsN7fRtt4VAYK5ZUrsop7j2e9oBperMZpkiJiiqQ2","user":"0x29519122d08771ca4c83c8e3fa981df18721f76d","type":"poi","title":"Remove the location 144,-14 from the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-04-24T19:01:00.792Z","finish_at":"2022-05-01T19:01:00.787Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":144,"y":-14,"type":"remove_poi","description":"This is our old DCL Real Estate office.

Free transactions mean that Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction they perform (in Polygon) while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera. \n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021. Biconomy works by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.** \n\n# Solution\n\nUp until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth. \n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp. \n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and keep the flywheel spinning: better UX > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nIf this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\", it will be promoted to a Draft proposing the DAO Committee to be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.","choices":["Yes: Authorize the DAO Committee to continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank","No: Do not continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":10922,"scores_total":957429.9226222913,"votes":80,"manaVP":56871.61237995662,"landVP":448000,"namesVP":9500,"delegatedVP":443058.3102423345,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"908896f0-c222-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4","snapshot_id":"QmQ3pX8vmz6TZ6XGyKM1FFgTnN1UzrGo9CVuxiXo5FXhPy","user":"0x73b8bfa9b609077999e41a4e6a3e233dbf70faa0","type":"linked_wearables","title":"Add NTR1-META to the Linked Wearables Registry","start_at":"2022-04-22T09:57:00.119Z","finish_at":"2022-04-29T09:57:00.118Z","required_to_pass":4000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"NTR1-META","links":["https://ntr1-meta.com/","https://swappable.io/","https://discord.com/invite/uZ4CePdaqY"],"nft_collections":"We have created a collection of 5,000 NFT wearable sneakers across 40 different designs and rarity tiers, created in collaboration with 25 of the hottest web3 projects, including exclusive sneaker wearables created in partnership with Decentraland, Polygon and The Sneakerheadz Society.\n\nThese NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers, which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.","items":5000,"smart_contract":["0xF20B2647679D32FF36dCD17Fe4FfA5661EF79E7b"],"governance":"This is a collaborative project between Another-1 and Swappable by TrustSwap.\n\nYou can find out more about Another-1 and their team with the following links:\n- https://another-1.io\n- https://twitter.com/AN1official\n\nYou can find out more about Swappable and TrustSwap with the following links:\n- https://swappable.io\n- https://twitter.com/Swappable_NFTs\n- https://trustswap.com\n- https://twitter.com/TrustSwap","motivation":"We are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!\n\nWe're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!\n\nWe moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ.

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations. \n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs. \n\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748","specification":"To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build. \n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.","personnel":"This momentous undertaking is a collaborative effort between: \n\n- Reporters without Borders\n- DDB Berlin\n- Metaverse Architects\n- Metaverse Group \n- Tokens.com \n- BlockWorks\n- Media.Monks\n\nEach organization contributes crucial elements to the project.\n\nMore info:\n\nReporters without Borders promote and defend the freedom to be informed and to inform others throughout the world.\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach Berlin (DDB) is a leading advertising firm dedicated to supporting The Uncensored Library’s mission.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses.

Companies that want to be involved in the project will be required to pay a one time Mana fee, which will include a personalized lobby with brand awareness. They will also be able to sell or offer their product or service for the real world, while the user is in the decentraland lobby. Initial investment will be able to fund full time moderators to be available to walk the mazes and help other users by answering questions and encouraging lobby hang outs.

At same time, user can invest in the lobby by posting unique art for consignment sale. NFT art will be able to be displayed throughout the entire maze, and a potential user can purchase NFT while in the maze and while playing the puzzle or game.

Would you be in support of updating the Marketplace UI to allow for fractional MANA pricing?\n\nRational\n\n*There are over 150 items in the primary market which are listed below 1 MANA.  This eliminates a reasonable resale market.\n\n*The small group that already appears to be pricing for fractional mana are mostly item farming accounts/bots.\n\n*By opening up the secondary market to lower valued items, it will increase the interest and accessibility to the market.  New users could save for higher valued or more desirable items without having to spend fiat to participate.  Many people cannot afford to purchase MANA, but almost everyone has items they have been given through events or content creator giveaways.\n\n*This could potentially SAVE the DAO in matic gas fees by reducing the number of junk listings which never sell, and get relisted by the thousands on a daily basis.  By establishing an actual value, less valuable items may find their way to the end consumer or long term investor faster.\n\nI previously submitted a similar proposal, but didn't take it seriously or put much effort into it.

But their art is that good that it absolutely has to be heard. We want to find these artists and make our offer. In addition we also support music and sound design for film, documentary and series. \n\nWith a “charitable social DeFi token” and Artist Project NFT´s it is possible for us to finance our NPO´s Projects and ensure a solid  Mission. \n\nIn addition to regular releases such as physical CD´s and digital Releases as Download and Streaming, we believe in creating NFT´s for each funded Artist Projects and each released Artist on our own Labels we just established. With our Music Publishing Department we are able to sync music to film, documentary and even commercial use. All to get our Artists a good revenue und to finance future projects on the long run.\n\nWe consider ourselves as a modern and open minded Organization useing all available optins to fullfill our Mission & Vision. Therefore it is mandatory that we also have a solid appearance in the metaverse and web 3.0.\n\nIf we get the grant we are going to invest it to purchase a huge piece of land or even an entire own Server to connect it to the Grid.\n\nWe want to use this appearance to explore new Artists for our Funding, network and connecting with our Followers and Supporters we might reach in Decentraland. \n\nThe Funds will also be used to finance the Projects of Artists we discover and find in Decentraland. \n\nWe have founded and taken over 4 Labels. We support all Genres of Music and consider ourselves as an up and coming Indie Major Label & Publisher just with an charitable Background and the Vision to ensure Artistic Freedom.\n\nOur Objectives are not just music support. We work with successful award winning Film Producers with productions on the Big Screen & the respective Streaming Platforms.

It will be a place like a Gallery. \n\nAs we can´t serve all Artists, we will have limited Spots. Artists can apply with examples and our A&R Team will decide about the Artists that are getting a Plot.

The Difference to a regular sold item in a Download Store is that NFT´s provide Studio Master Files, exclusive NFT-only Content. NFTs will be available 6-8 weeks BEFORE the Public release.\n\nThe Store will be Open to any other Artist with digital Art so we offer a wide range of music and digital Art to Decentraland.\n\nCreative Sandbox for In-World Builders\n\nWe will offer a Sandbox for Decentraland Builders who like to create any sort of Art inside of Decentraland. Same as with the Artist Plots, we offer Plots of different sizes free of charge to Builders. They can create their Project and keep it there for around 4 weeks and place also a Donation Box to get some tips for their creation.The Building Artists decide also on the Donation Split to the Foundation.","personnel":"Our Founders and Team consist of Artists, Audio Engineers, Radio Hosts, Film- and Theatre Actors, DJ´s.

This will facilitate the provision of cutting-edge DCL experiences for the Decentraland community, and shall allow our project to provide even more value to the space.\n \nThe scope of creating mental health spaces within the metaverse is quite literally endless but we want to begin this journey within Decentraland by focusing first on the unique needs of the users. Our long-term vision includes scaling to incorporate events, NFT creations, dynamic building of scenes and exclusive content. \nBy doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland with the idea of making it the first metaverse platform to create engagement and traction for inclusive mental wellbeing","personnel":"This project is a collaborative endeavor between Mind-Easy, Metaverse Architects and The Metaverse Group.\n\nMind-Easy offers a refreshing approach to mental health: it aims to take the totality of the individual into account and presents tailored therapy that promotes healing, growth and empowerment.

Approved third parties will be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs as Wearables in Decentraland.\n\nThis is one more step of a long process, below theres is a list of the proposals involved:\n\n1.

In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when navigating through Decentraland.\n\nThe goal of this project is to **onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.","specification":"**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not **[regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/)**. They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. **They can not be bought or sold in Decentraland’s Marketplace.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1. **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.\n2. Wait one week for DAO's approval and pass the 4M VP threshold.\n3. **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available Slots.\n4. Develop the API following [this specification](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n5. Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n6. Spread the word! Tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**Application Process**\n\nThird parties will create a DAO proposal in the category “Linked Wearables Registry” to be accepted in the registry. The vote will last for a week and will require a minimum threshold of participation of 4M VP.\n\nThe inclusion of the third party into the Registry will be done by the DAO Committee. This process will create slots for the third party and enable access to the publication flow.\n\n**Slots**\n\nA Slot is a potential representation of an NFT as a Decentraland Wearable. They define the maximum amount of different wearables designs the Third Party can use.\n\nDepending on the strategy the collection owners choose, they can request 1 slot (i.e. All holders of the NFT collection will get the same Linked Wearable) or multiple slots (i.e. If the collection has 7,777 NFTs they can request for 7,777 slots to match the wearable with the NFTs look & feel)\n\nSlots are free and requested by third parties on their application. They can later request more slots if necessary.\n\n**Wearable Submission**\n\nThe Third Party will be able to use the Builder tool to submit a wearable design for each Slot. The wearable model must follow the same specs as any regular wearables and will be subject to the curation process of the Wearable Curation Committee.\n\n**API Development**\n\nOnce the wearables are submitted to review the third party must create an API that resolves the assignment between NFT owners and Decentraland Wearables.\n\nThis is a scalable and cross-chain solution to accommodate different scenarios. The API might assign the same wearable for every NFT holder; or different wearables for different groups of NFT holders; or even more, a unique design for each NFT holder.\n\n**Curation Process**\n\nThe Wearable Curation Committee will curate the submitted wearables as part of their regular flow. The curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.\n\nFor Programmatic Collections with more the 50 items, the curation won’t review each design one by one, instead, a new curation process will be executed following these general guidelines:\n\n1. Audit the wearable generation process.\n2. Define a curation plan based on the process.\n3. Curate 1% of the collection (min 50, max 300).","impacts":"Linked Wearables will enable NFT Communities to customize their avatar in Decentraland. This is beneficial for both parties because the **NFTs get a new use case** (adding value to the collection and the community) and also, new users will be exposed to Decentraland’s experience.\n\nThis proposal will create a new flow of publication of wearables that might compete with the current publication process. This issue is mitigated by several factors:\n\n1. **Third Parties need to be approved by the DAO** in order to use this publication flow.\n2. The NFTs associated with **these wearables can’t be traded in Decentraland’s marketplace.**\n3. Third-party need their own NFT smart contract and build/maintain a public API for the integration to work.\n\nThe DAO will not receive submission fees for this process but still cover the compensation of the Wearable Curator Committee, thus increase DAO’s expenses. However, with the current situation of the DAO treasury this shouldn’t be a limitation, and instead see it as a marketing investment.\n\nThe Linked Wearables project will also incentivize the wearable creation economy, generating more jobs for 3d designers and studios with experience in Decentraland. The NFT communities won’t pay the DAO a submission fee but will invest resources in those with knowledge in the craft of wearable making.\n\nExpected upsides:\n\n- Onboard many NFT communities to Decentraland.\n- Become a case study about interoperability between NFT projects.\n\nUndesirable (but possible) outcomes:\n\n- Communities might not gather enough VP to be listed in the Linked Wearables Registry.\n- Implementation and maintenance of integration might be costly for members of the Linked Wearables Registry.","implementation_pathways":"The implementation of this feature involves the following applications:\n\n- Governance dApp.\n    - Enable the external NFT communities to propose themselves for the registry.\n- Linked Wearables Registry - A new dApp to manage the registry.\n    - DAO Committee Members can add new members to the registry.\n    - DAO Committee Members can manage available slots for registry members.\n    - Registry members can update their managers and resolver API.\n\n- Builder Tool\n    - Managers of the communities listed on the Linked Wearable Registry will be able to create collections using their available slots and submit them to review.\n    - Wearable Curation Committee will review the collections and upload the content to the catalysts network upon approval.\n\n- Third-party API\n    - This is an external API maintained by the third parties in Linked Wearables Registry.\n    - It enables the mapping between NFT owners and submitted wearables.\n\n- World Explorer:\n    - Wearables linked to external NFTs will be displayed in the explorer's backpack.","conclusion":"This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer.

It will do so by increasing the collateralized MANA in Maker protocol and increasing the liquidity volumes in decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n**Background**\n\n [MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/) , one of the oldest DAOs, provides a significant service to the crypto and decentralized finance space: it’s the DAO behind the stablecoin known as DAI. DAI’s value is backed by different crypto assets such as ETH, USDC, USDT, etc. The MakerDAO community defines DAI as a “decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar.” DAI’s collateral backing, then, is part of the stablecoin’s essence.\n\nIn July 2020,  [MakerDAO included MANA](https://blog.makerdao.com/mana-approved-by-maker-governance-as-collateral-type-in-the-maker-protocol/)  as acceptable collateral for minting new DAI in the platform. This authorization represented excellent news for MANA, since it meant an upgrade in its status as a reserve of value. Users could now take out a DAI loan using their MANA as collateral without the need to sell it first.\n\nYet, in late 2021, MANA almost got downgraded again in a sudden turn of events. The attempt began with a signal request, a formal proposition for action or change in a specific platform. Signal requests are usually coupled with polls through which the community votes whether accept or decline the proposals. In September 2021,  [a signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-mana-bat-zrx-lrc-univ2-linketh-and-univ2-aaveeth/10467)  from the MakerDAO forum presented a plan to remove MANA and some other tokens as acceptable collateral. By the time the polls closed in early October, the initiative had gathered enough votes to offboard and delist many tokens. But MANA, for its part, was spared from the offboarding. Thanks to community signaling, which advised against a downgrade, MANA persisted in the list of acceptable collateral for minting new DAI.\n\nAs observed per the cited signal request, the MakerDAO is interested in delisting unprofitable collateral types. The MakerDAO has sufficient incentive to remove the less efficient collateral types. First off, every collateral type has some fixed costs on oracle price feeds. On the other hand, each collateral type brings extra complexity to the team maintaining the project.\n\nIn this vein, MakerDAO is interested in seeing more DAI minted with MANA as collateral; otherwise, MANA might be delisted and no longer stand as acceptable collateral. Also, MakerDAO would like to see more liquidity in exchanges between MANA and DAI. They expect such increased liquidity because, if the price of MANA were to drop abruptly, a more liquid scenario would help reduce the risk of liquidating an undercollateralized position of MANA. \n\n**Description**\n\nThe current fee to mint DAI using MANA as collateral is 6% annually.\n\nAfter conversations with MakerDAO, they might consider reducing this fee to 3% if we (1) reach 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA while (2) increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\nThere are methodic steps in reaching both goals. Thus, this proposal describes the use of the DAOs Treasury holdings to increase the MANA collateral and liquidity in exchanges — therefore matching the two standards that MakerDAO expects.\n\nAs a side note, it’s important to mention that if this initiative succeeds, it will result in a very positive outcome for the MANA holding community. In what would be a significant step ahead, a MANA holder looking to request a loan using her MANA as collateral will find her annual rates cut by half.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe straightforward way to tackle the dual challenge would be contributing towards liquidity. So, for the sake of examples, let’s say the DAO wants to contribute 5M in collateralized MANA for this cause.\n\nTo contribute such a sum, The DAO would need to take some MANA from its treasury and lock it in a Maker Volt. In exchange for it, the DAO would receive 5M of DAI. This is, quite plainly, a loan collateralized with MANA.\n\nSuch a loan should be over-collateralized to ensure we don’t lose the collateral in the sudden event of a MANA price drop. Therefore, the suggestion is to do a 3x collateralized ratio. At the current MANA price, that would signify ~6,200,000 MANA, which would, in turn, represent 5M of DAI.\n\nAt the moment, we should pay an annual interest rate of 6%. Thus, keeping up with the former logic, it would represent 180,000 DAI. But that’s the worst-case scenario. Since the whole initiative intends to succeed, MakerDAO will eventually reduce this fee to 3%, thus downsizing the sum to half.\n\nAfterward, we should position 5M of DAI + 5M worth of MANA in the MANA<>DAI Liquidity Pool at Sushiswap. Why Sushiswap? It’s simple: it has the deepest liquidity for the pair in any DEX. According to this  [MANA/DAI liquidity poll](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x495f8ef80e13e9e1e77d60d2f384bb49694823ef)  (LP), we can expect a return of investment of 2,000 DAI per day. It would not only cover the costs of the loan — but it would also leave a significant margin in net DAO profits.\n\nThe previous example, then, would prove successful in achieving the double goal of accruing 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA, all while increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith a set of strategic steps, Decentraland’s DAO can significantly contribute to securing MANA’s position in the DAI ecosystem, maintaining MANA as acceptable collateral, reducing the loan fees for MANA holders, and improving the liquidity of DEXs.\n\nThere is a tested strategy to address this issue, and the DAO suggests we take on it.\n\nVote\n* For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO\n* Against: Do nothing","choices":["For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO","Against: Do nothing","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":10087,"scores_total":946373.9030559347,"votes":20,"manaVP":157856.76761776154,"landVP":214000,"namesVP":2500,"delegatedVP":572017.1354381732,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmchxF8CU2ehk9svKfZUSUCpzqwEsFG6ZDEanQhmdiaEaL","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"draft","title":"Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members","start_at":"2022-03-28T08:45:00.362Z","finish_at":"2022-04-04T08:45:00.360Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"passed","configuration":{"linked_proposal_id":"782bbe80-9adf-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","title":"Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members","summary":"The DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.","abstract":"The DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:\n\n- When a committee member resigns\n- When the community wants to replace a committee member\n- When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency\n\nThere are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:\n\n- Decisions must be as decentralized as possible\n-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee\n- Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together\n-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency\n\nBearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.","motivation":"**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.","specification":"**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1. **By the DAO Committee:**\n- Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n- After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n- Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n- DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2. **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n- The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\nAfter 24 hours, the member is removed\n- 3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n- In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n- Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n- If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3. **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n- The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    - The name of the committee member to remove\n    - Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n- To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP. \n- The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n- If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\nIn the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n1. If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2. If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n- In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n- The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.\n- The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.\n- The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications","conclusion":"**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n1. What is your full name?\n2. What is your primary wallet address?\n3. Why are you applying?\n4. What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?\n5. What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6. Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7. Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8. Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.   \n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process. \n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":10080,"scores_total":2078227.9689618056,"votes":25,"manaVP":1142991.3453940824,"landVP":168000,"namesVP":5400,"delegatedVP":761836.6235677229,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"2d2a9f40-adfa-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmVZwLszSs9Cuc223Nr5n7MJwXbZhME1kbAHJzX2fPQfCS","user":"0xe7e477ef1676a46ae6621983834a6e0b29c06979","type":"grant","title":"Affordable Housing (Apartments and Townhomes)","start_at":"2022-03-27T18:17:00.284Z","finish_at":"2022-04-10T18:17:00.282Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Affordable Housing (Apartments and Townhomes)","abstract":"We are a small group of technical artists and coders who have recently fallen in love with the decentraland metaverse.

In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours.

The [original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) (this one), where this feature was introduced and first described. It was called Third Party Wearables at that moment. Here is a short phrase that captures its intent:\n    \n    *In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.*\n    \n    The process to make Linked Wearables was simple, but there were some things that where not detailed. That’s where the second proposal comes in. \n    \n2. [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) for Linked Wearables: As you may have read from the original proposal, third parties needed to buy Slots for each 3D representation of their NFTs. But at which price? The result of that proposal was to make it pair with the current submission fee for regular wearables. This makes sense, but if you dig deeper, some differences come evident. For example, Linked Wearables can not be sold in the marketplace, they don’t have rarities and are not exactly wearables. So it may be worth to be thought again and find a better balance. \n3. [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) came third to cover a particular use case that was brought up by interested third parties. The fact is that many communities interested in this have really large collections that were made programmatically. This means a software combined a set of pre-designed traits to get the final models as a result. With the fee defined in the prior proposal, it got totally restrictive for these communities as it would cost millions to have Linked Wearables, getting all of us far from the spirit of the feature, which should be inclusive by definition. \n\nA lot has been learned from past proposals. Now, I’d like to propose an improvement that would help this feature to meet its true goal: **Onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.","specification":"**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not [regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/). They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. \n\nLinked Wearables do not exist inside traditional wearable collections, have no rarity, and **can not** be sold in [primary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item&section=wearables) or [secondary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=nft&section=wearables&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=recently_listed&onlyOnSale=true&viewAsGuest=false&onlySmart=false) markets. They are only **in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the Third Party.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1. **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available. \n2. Wait one week for DAO's approval. Ask your community for help, they can vote for you to be accepted. \n3. **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available **Slots**. Once the item is submitted to the builder you will see a property called **URN**. That **URN** is the one that you will need to use in the [API response](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n4. Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n5. Develop the API.\n6. Spread the word! tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**So what is missing though?**\n\nThere are 3 very important things that were not addressed in the previous lines or need to be reviewed:\n\n1. What would be the **VP (voting power)** threshold needed for Third Parties to be approved (not discussed yet)\n2. What would be the final **price of each slot** \n3. How many items will **curators review** in programmatic and hand-made collections\n\nEven though the price of slots were set at a fixed rate of 500 USD and the approach to curate programmatic collections was declined (details mentioned above), I propose the following combination to support third parties and, at the same time, being cautious of which third party is actually approved:\n\n1. **4M VP threshold**\n\nThis would be a blocker for scammers and people with bad intentions that don’t have a strong community and only want to abuse this feature by flooding the catalyst network with 3D Models. At the same time, only legit communities would pass this filter. \n\n2. **Free slots**\n\nThe DAO will be the only beneficiary from a fee here, but as the goal is to encourage communities to come into Decentraland, the DAO could afford this and give Slots to Third Parties when they need them. \n\n3. **\"Reasonable\" curation**\n\nHand-made collections have to be curated in full as there is no guarantee on how each 3D model was made, but for programmatic collections, the perfect balance would be to:\n\n1. Audit the process \n\n2. Curate 1% of the collection \n\n3. Minimum of 50 items to be curated (if the programmatic collection has less than 50 items, it has to be curated in full)\n\n4. Maximum of 300 items to be curated\n    \nCuration fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.","conclusion":"This should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote 😄.\n\n**Voting Options**\n\n**In favor:** 4M VP to accept third parties + free slots + Reasonable curation\n\n**Against:** 1M VP to accept third parties + 500 USD slots + Curating every item in every collection","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":9884,"scores_total":3691299.72825337,"votes":30,"manaVP":1643024.6777157476,"landVP":1880000,"namesVP":17800,"delegatedVP":150475.05053762314,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"bfa89b30-aa01-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231","snapshot_id":"QmcezstPnzpvHMQvDamgxBwBb7VfJNcLav8j453EQu7bMp","user":"0xfe2d424af0df49bb3316cb2e9f574b0d09cf98ad","type":"grant","title":"Building DecentralWear Community Center","start_at":"2022-03-22T17:01:00.883Z","finish_at":"2022-04-05T17:01:00.882Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Building DecentralWear Community Center","abstract":"We are a team of Decentraland community members who are passionate to give back with the mission of becoming a hub for community members to equip them with in-demand skills and develop another source of income in the Decentraland metaverse.\n\nWe have already built several projects in Decentraland, such as Play2Earn Parkour Courses, Wear2Earn Meta board Wearables, Decentraland Dating Club Love, and free DecentrAcademy Community Classes.

Hence, we moved into SciArtLab where we have scaled into a cineplex with 6 floors including 3 floors with movie screens. SciArtLab has been a major support in marketing our vision to fellow DCL players. Check out the district http://district.sciartlab.com/\n\nWe are also building partnerships with rights owners from the entertainment industry. Some of the people that we have acquired from are\n\n1. Wave Films - http://wave-films.com/\n\n2. IndieRights -https://www.indierights.com/\n\n3. NewGen Entertainment - https://www.newgenentertainment.it/\n\n4. Josh Stifter - https://twitter.com/joshstifter\n\n5. Bitjoin Studios -https://twitter.com/bitjoin\n\nNew partners in the pipeline\n\n1. GlobalFlix - https://www.globalflix.tv/globalflix-studios\n\n2. TVCO - https://www.tvco.eu/\n\n3. Minerva Pictures - https://www.minervapicturesinternational.com/\n\n4. Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF\n\nAs mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes\n\n1. We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2. We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1. Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live\nhttps://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\n2. Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.\n\n3. Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare. We have growing foot traffic of about 1000-1500 players per week already.","specification":"Our Filmrare scene is already live at 2,55. Our monthly tasks and the cost associated are below\n\n1.

First we will help DCL organizers to create events using our platform while also developing more features and building partnerships with event organizers and districts.\n\n**Stage 2**. Once the user base starts to flourish events will be frequently created. Now our focus will shift from doing manual things to getting sure the platform can scale. For this we will create a strong documentation and tutorial videos. Meanwhile we will still develop new features.\n\n**Stage 3**.

This means that each item was not crafted individually by hand, but automatically generated with code, many times from traits that were previously designed and modeled. [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks), [CryptoAvatars](https://opensea.io/collection/averagepunks-) and [BAYC](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) are examples of Programmatic Collections. \n\n## Motivation\n\nIt is very unpractical, and almost impossible, to curate all the wearables in a large collection of 10k items, or more. It is also prohibitively expensive for third parties. But if that collection was made programmatically, it may not be necessary to curate every item one by one. It would make much more sense to audit the **process** used to generate that collection and curate a **random portion** of the items. Like when you are boiling spaghetti, you don’t need to try them all to know when it’s ready ;)\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a proposal to introduce a new and more efficient way to curate this particular case of collections for Linked Wearables. It will make it easier and faster for the curator, shorten the time to put the collection in production, and save costs for the third parties. \n\nThe new mechanic consists of 2 parts:\n\n1. **Reviewing the method:** the curator will review the programmatic method used to create the items in the collection. If the method proves to be generating items programatically with the same base traits, it will follow up with the second step.\n2. **Reviewing items in the collection:** as the items were not created individually - but automatically with a previously validated programmatic method - there is no need to review each item in the collection. Reviewing just a random portion of the items will be enough to validate the rest. The curator will randomly choose X% items in the collection and curate only those. X% to be defined in this proposal. \n\n## Voting\n\nVote to define “X”, meaning the portion of the collection to be curated to consider it approved as a whole.\n\n1. **YES: X = 1%**\n2. **YES: X = 0.5%**\n3. **YES: X = 0.25%**\n4. **YES: X = 0.1%**\n5. **NO:** Decline this curation method for programmatic collections in Linked Wearables\n\n### Examples\n\n- **“x” = 1%:** If 1% of the items in the collection have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 100 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 100 wearables*\n- **“x” = 0.5%:** If 0.5% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 50 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 50 wearables*\n- **“x” = 0.25%:** If 0.25% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 3k items, then 8 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 8 wearables*\n- **“x” = 0.1%:** If 0.1% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 10 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10 wearables*\n- **NO:** If the collection has 10k items and this curation method is not implemented, then 10k items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10k wearables*\n\n*(USD 500 per wearable as defined in [the past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)). \n\nNote: consider that, if a Third Party has to pay for *all* the items in a large collection, the price could be extremely restrictive for any Third Party. For example: at current curation prices, if the collection has 10k items, the price for the curation would be 5 million US dollars!","choices":["YES: 1%","YES: 0.5%","YES: 0.25%","YES: 0.1%","NO","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":9253,"scores_total":5762576.385614505,"votes":31,"manaVP":5131271.369291254,"landVP":86000,"namesVP":2600,"delegatedVP":542705.0163232503,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"d2b78c40-a08d-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmdTN1xxovCvH5VgJ2kqDb8CULB2irDZQukwc5eU4v4q5w","user":"0x5f0c7c4d0f9b4dc109f2ce986f9ca81aaad349b5","type":"grant","title":"Adding Mint #s to the Marketplace","start_at":"2022-03-10T16:19:00.772Z","finish_at":"2022-03-17T16:19:00.770Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Adding Mint #s to the Marketplace","abstract":"When in the Marketplace you cannot see the Mint #s in prior to selecting the item.

Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.\n\nOur primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:\n- Make available a NFT ticket marketplace\n- Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers\n- Increase amount of events hosted\n- Grow daily active users\n- Expand awareness in the metaverse community\n- Create more use cases for LAND owners\n- Build interest in brands sponsoring future metaverse events\n- Improve user experience for event attendees\n- Increase wearable sales\n- Surge wearable and build creations\n- Provide our building on the metaverse as a people to meet & network\n- Help make Decentraland mainstream","specification":"In order for this to be possible we are building a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.\n\nWe also have created the Events SDK that allows event organizers to give access to the event to users who have purchased tickets. \n\nLink to the Github repo: https://github.com/Fanszoid\n\nUsing our Events SDK, event organizers will also be able to:\n- Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on. \n- Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event\n- Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating a post event ticket valuation.\n- Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration\n\nNow in-person event tickets could be attached to a Decentraland wearable. \n\nIn addition, we are communicating with the Festival District team, who worked with Decentraland on The Metaverse Festival, to see how Fanszoid could meet the future needs of promoters who need a ticketing solution. \n\nAs a final detail, we’ve launched our MVP, feel free to try it out. \nhttps://app.fanszoid.com/ \n\nFor more info about our proposal you can check this presentation:\nhttps://bit.ly/Fanszoid \n\nYou can also find us at: \n\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanszoid/ \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/fanszoid \n\nWebsite - https://www.fanszoid.com/ \n\nTelegram - https://t.me/fanszoid \n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/GBv89mWgbQ","personnel":"Julian Neuss - Co-Founder & CEO - Software Engineer & crypto enthusiast.

Because people can earn NFTs.\n\nTo get people to engage with our properties, NFTs, ads, billboards, etc., we need to encourage them to engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas.

These can be earned by exploring 20 miles of Decentraland.\n\nCuriosity Cap – Awarded for opening 150+ UIs to outside websites.

This will be agreed with Decentraland.\n\nWe will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.\n\nMilestone 3: Delivery\n\nDeliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20\\&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":8672,"scores_total":1987048.3098752054,"votes":31,"manaVP":53343.699692297756,"landVP":184000,"namesVP":80200,"delegatedVP":1669504.6101829074,"vesting_address":"0x06ec824F9b243E7fd1B6798614d5cc24A320E390","enacting_tx":null},{"id":"783b3810-94ae-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmcdTxnpkuAoyKdhC8uq6txk4rKAVBmufKmfdKgK2JZRZo","user":"0x5eff77571184427f5a9e951597571b5259820b48","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -94,-99 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-23T13:42:00.401Z","finish_at":"2022-03-02T13:42:00.401Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-94,"y":-99,"type":"add_poi","description":"The brand new vEmpire Amphitheatre is a stunning recreation of an old Roman theatre in its prime.\n\nWe believe it's the best example of Roman architecture in Decentraland, and it can be used for hosting large events, complete with NFT private areas.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":8665,"scores_total":598545.4924337373,"votes":13,"manaVP":24127.720653401473,"landVP":32000,"namesVP":6400,"delegatedVP":536017.7717803358,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"5f49dfa0-94ae-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmPNLFwyhERxvBoE4e5cgtmfiCBP8rVKYcApLC64X8rgB1","user":"0x5eff77571184427f5a9e951597571b5259820b48","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -94,-99 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-23T13:41:00.554Z","finish_at":"2022-03-02T13:41:00.552Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-94,"y":-99,"type":"add_poi","description":"The brand new vEmpire Amphitheatre is a stunning recreation of an old Roman theatre in its prime.\n\nWe believe it's the best example of Roman architecture in Decentraland, and it can be used for hosting large events, complete with NFT private areas.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":8664,"scores_total":16127.47597917355,"votes":10,"manaVP":1427.4759791735507,"landVP":14000,"namesVP":700,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"40bb3970-93dd-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a","snapshot_id":"QmfXbhgQs92D3VhsLXFcfytvieBmG7q5U1GsVr3hZHPPF3","user":"0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198","type":"poll","title":"Should fractional MANA pricing be added to the User Interface for Secondary Market listings?","start_at":"2022-02-22T12:45:00.471Z","finish_at":"2022-02-27T12:45:00.470Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Should fractional MANA pricing be added to the User Interface for Secondary Market listings?","description":"After speaking with a mentor on discord, I was advised that the ability to list items for fractional MANA on the secondary market has always been allowed per the smart contract.

This prevents the “expressiveness” of the community from leading the charge and bringing amazing things to the ecosystem. As the wearable market flourished once opened to the community by removing the centrality of wearable creation/publishing.\n\nSolution:\nJust as we have done with wearables, we should open nft emotes for creators to load their .fbx and other standardized movement files to be used by their avatars. This in turn would not only add a whole other dimension for creators to utilize, but it would also allow for additional revenues to return to the DAO from submission fees and royalties. This would add a new class of asset for Decentraland’s current and future users.\n\nImportance of movement:\nScience shows that a majority of how we communicate is through body language, and without allowing the community of creators to inject their creativity through that medium we are holding our users back in the very area we are trying to open to them; deep and meaningful ways to connect and communicate with others online. \n\nCase Study to Demonstrate Feasibility:\nSome barriers which have limited this from being a possibility is the access to movement data, which often is not very simple to access whether due to cost or proprietary reasons. For this reason it has been easier to have the movements hard coded, and as special surprises through the year. \n\nWith the expansion of uses within the web3 space, a new company MetaMoves has published NFTs which give the holder owner of the actual movement data, with standard files such as .fbx. They are already utilizing this to animate other avatars such as MeeBits, and the same could be realized for Decentraland Users. It would allow us to carry into Decentraland an important part of our identity. That goofy wave or dance move; if you don’t speak I may think you are shy, but if you stop moving… I’ll call an ambulance! Movement has a deep connection to being alive, let’s liberate movement and help Decentraland accomplish something no other metaverse has before.","choices":["Yes - I would like for the Decentraland Developement Team to prioritize building a UI/UX for creators to load in their own movements.

It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.\n\nI hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.\n\nWe can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.","specification":"This module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles.

Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.\n\nThe currently planned features are:\n-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.\n-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)\n-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.\n-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.\n-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game.","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo.

Providing the community the ability to participate in the style of gameplay they are most comfortable  will eliminate one of the biggest reasons ive personally heard,  not being forced to use a keyboard and mouse- thus shortening a learning curve, will shift a potential players midset  from \"ahhh- i dont want to go through all of that right now...\" as they then move on to continue playing COD. To viewing it as, \"its right there-, ill give it a shot, why not\"... and anyone thats had xbox live understands the mental process im speaking of.  I personally believe providing this to users would result in more users opting to try Decentraland than just about any other ad campaign- im almost certain of that. Plus considering I have it more than half finished, (i can provide gameplay samples if youd like) Could be implemented within a few weeks at most. thanks for the support from those of you i have already spoken with, im anxious to see how the rest of you feel about it- i look forward to it. - thanks.","specification":"i have everything available upon request, being as im not accredited, i probably dont have  the exact terminology and technical documentation, the result of my work will speak for its self- its performing without any flaw, no bugs, lol no copyright violations- i assure you its in good standing . i have practical use and gameplay videos to confirm my claims.","personnel":"ha im just a single dad to three kids, my 3rd was just flown to pit hospital on the 27th because she had polycythemia, no worries shes good now. 38,600$ for a 40 minute helicopter ride if youre curious, its a joke- im just still releasing stress and im seriously just happy shes here with us now. what made me mention this- is the whole reason i even began this project, and that was- my 4 year old ella, always wants to be included no matter what it is im actively doing. well i started playing Decentraland , and she kept asking to try and of course im going to little things like this make her so happy, but she would trash everything- and i mean everything... 9/10 time just totally exiting out of where i was, i think she might have bought an nft.. but ultimately i decided something had to be done, so i just dedicated my free time to finding a more enjoyable experience for her (me) so thats how i got here- ive been coding and modding ,designing you name it, ever since i was a kid, im one of the late 90s early 00s pro opensource ,stick it to the man teen hackers, lol- then i had to work for him, im sure the story is all too familiar...but yeah, its just me on this project an thats all i forsee moving forward-  what ive completed  thus far is working than better  i could have hoped for... every action can be remapped in the manner you wish. just need to finish and release it.","roadmap":"I have more than 60 % finished, it wont take me more than a few weeks 3 is the absolute Max, ( and thats an excessive estimation -just to give myself room incase something crazy and unexpected happens)- the hardest part was locating and patching the bug in windows.

The only action Decentraland’s DAO would have is setting up a new contract that points the secondary fees from OpenSea et al to the new L1 Wearables DAO.\n\nUpon creation of the DAO, an L1 Wearable snapshot would be taken, and holders of L1 wearables, prior and up to the snapshot being taken, would be issued governance tokens for the DAO.\n\nThe DAO could then vote on dispersing those funds to holders of the governance token, delegating them to a representative, and voting on other project initiatives such as creating an L1 Wearables Museum in Decentraland.\n\nFor the L1 Wearables DAO Governance Token proposal, I think we can get more granular, in terms of token weightings, by creating a more complex algorithm based on factors like:\n\nOwns more than 2 items from multiple collections\nHas sold an items on OpenSea/Decentraland’s Marketplace\nNFT Count\nWeighted Collection Date Average (ie are most of your L1 wearables from the first collection or last collections on L1 – were you an early adopter)\n\n[Closing Remarks]\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback. \n\nWe need to push forward as a community and L1 wearables has quite the storied past. As stated in my other proposal, I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market. \n\nLet's revitalize this community and push for the decentralization that we promised each other; a better tomorow, which starts with decentralizing revenue streams from the L1 Wearables.\n\nCheers,\nSuperMANA","choices":["Approve Transferring L1 Royalties to a L1 Wearables DAO","Reject Proposal","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7707,"scores_total":1064511.141803271,"votes":8,"manaVP":742.3576828500254,"landVP":68000,"namesVP":10400,"delegatedVP":985368.7841204208,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"ab106370-8872-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmcpmMzxSUYv9fG5tSJR7ZmhXGtARio8p1tnJ57mtQ4Fvx","user":"0xdab85506424396fb090d84b64ad63b770d87c028","type":"poll","title":"Ethereum (L1) Wearables: A Comprehensive Proposal | Voting Power [Part 1]","start_at":"2022-02-08T00:04:00.927Z","finish_at":"2022-02-13T00:04:00.925Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Ethereum (L1) Wearables: A Comprehensive Proposal | Voting Power [Part 1]","description":"For those who have been here since inception, or rather close-to, have had the unique opportunity to watch Decentraland blossom into the iconic metaverse platform that it is today.\n\nThe nascent success that it’s experiencing today wasn’t a straight-forward path, and many community members here can attest to that.

Here, they pegged the NFT price to USD and also did not accept MANA.\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-binance-against-covid19/\n\nThose who were asked to purchased NFT wearables in MANA for the Halloween 2019 collection were hurt the most by this decision.\n\nMajority of the collection was sold, not acquired via play-to-earn methods. The prices were as follows:\n\nMythic Items: 5,000 MANA\nLegendary Items: 500 MANA\nEpic Items: 100 MANA\n\nThe items and original address can be found here:\nhttps://opensea.io/0x93a7c46443901c2ea2fc1263a4d076f470695d3a?tab=created&search[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE&search[resultModel]=ASSETS&search[sortAscending]=true\n\nUpon the launch of this predominantly-purchase only collection, admins in Decentraland’s Discord “advertised” how to access OpenSea and buy these items set at the *market* price, which turned out to not be sticky.\n\n2.\tDeveloper/Admin/Foundation Member(s) of Decentraland sold their wearable NFTs to the community in exchange for MANA, often farming them before other community members could acquire them. There’s on-chain and YouTube history of this for the Xmas 2019 and Moonshot 2020 events.\n\nTo gain bipartisanship in this matter, I will withhold naming these particular members of the team for now and not share the recently curated Google Doc detailing the advertisement of wearables on OpenSea and Admins selling them to the community. Nonetheless, it is disappointing how certain individuals dumped on the community and rose to prominent positions within the DAO without any recourse or apologizing.\n\nIt is imperative to highlight this issue, as it showcases the poorly designed incentives that members of the team have to care about the L1 Wearable community, as many have sold a good portion of their NFTs, especially their earliest, most rare mints. \n\nAs an ombudsman for the wearables community, a resounding comment that has been made frequently is: “Paper hands are never rewarded, and the community expresses little sorrow in knowing that we had higher expectations of this project than those members of the project who dumped their NFTs on the community.”\n\n[PROPOSAL]\n\nNow that we’ve cleared the air on the points of contention, let’s jump into the proposed solutions.\n\n1.\tGrant Wearables Voting Power\n\nA flat amount of voting power per each L1 Wearable is the simplest solution, as the devs have mentioned; even though, Decentraland’s unique property design for wearables complicates this.\n\nDAO Weighting for L1 Holders:\n\nAccording to the data I pulled from GraphQL (this data should be validated by the community), the distribution is as follows for rarity type:\n\nUnique             |\t             4   |         0.005%\nMythic\t     |          984   |       1.224%\nLegendary     |   13,229   |    16.449%\nEpic\t             |   28,775   |    35.780%\nRare\t             |   25,713   |    31.972%\nUncommon   |     6,309   |        7.845%\nCommon\t     |     5,409   |         6.726%\nTotal\t             |  80,423   |      100.00%\n\nWe sit on the shoulders of giants; those who came before us. Under this premise, I feel that pioneers of Decentraland should be rewarded for their time and bravery. For those just joining the community, there have been many moments along this journey where community members have shared losses.\n\nVoting Power should be assigned in a two-tier ranking system, in an easy to assign manner for the Decentraland developers.\n\nWith this in mind, I propose a two-tier Voting Power weight.\nBeing the first collection, the Exclusive Mask collection, stands out in this regard. In addition, since the Halloween 2019 collection was a primary-purchase only collection, which hindered the democratic of many L1 holders, this collection should also be in that tier.\n\nBeing that the Xmas 2019 was a bugfest, I also propose including this collection into that same standalone tier. Lastly, to be included, should be the MCH (MyCryptoHeroes) collection, especially after some of the collection was incorrectly listed under the Mythic background color, which hurt many buyers. \n\nAll four of these collections were minted in 2019. Please note the 2019 weightings coincide with prices that Decentraland charged for the Halloween 2019 collection, save for rare(s) which were not sold but scales with proposed mint count.\n\n2019 Collections                    | Voting Power\nMythic/Exclusive Masks    | 5000\nLegendary/MCH                     | 500\nEpic\t                                           | 100\nRare\t                                           | 10\nUncommon\t\t                   | N/A\nCommon\t\t                           | N/A\n\n>2019 Collections                 | Voting Power\nUnique/Mythic                        | 1000\nLegendary                                   | 100\nEpic\t                                           | 10\nRare\t                                           | 2\nUncommon\t\t                   | 1\nCommon\t\t                           | 1\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback. \n\nWe need to push forward as a community and this has been quite the gray cloud. I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market.

DCL implements a smart contract to mint a corresponding NFT for each subdomain and allow the NFT owner to claim the subdomain (in case of transfers). These NFTs are then used to identify if a user owns the name or not, and if they do, they can set it as their Avatar Name.\n\n\nWith a few changes, DCL can allow subdomains of the dcl names to be minted as NFTs and integrate them into the naming system to allow names like xxx.name (the corresponding ENS subdomain would be xxx.name.dcl.eth)\n\nThe Name Registry smart contract is already designed in such a way that it could theoretically work to mint subdomains for any base domain (or subdomain). Implementing this change would just require a slightly modified version of this contract to exist along with the base names. NFTs generated through new smart contracts can then be included in the naming system.\n\nNote: if someone wants to enable subdomains for their name, they would have to transfer ownership of the name to a smart contract.","choices":["Allow subdomain names for DCL names to be registered","Do not allow it","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7480,"scores_total":756620.4795297567,"votes":43,"manaVP":34181.304529756606,"landVP":288000,"namesVP":278200,"delegatedVP":156239.175,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"1fa3dec0-8525-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmVEReUNCgebmyzNjpArhXbC1rjVUpS8VZn89NZocCps4Q","user":"0x90db61232fd019a7083876f3d0a649799135f8f6","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -23,-2 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-03T19:11:00.276Z","finish_at":"2022-02-10T19:11:00.274Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-23,"y":-2,"type":"add_poi","description":"GenesisProud is the very first Metaverse space for the LGBTQ community.

The DAO facilitator’s support in the drafting of the proposal is not an endorsement. This is a Draft Proposal, and will require 2M Votes to be promoted to the final voting stage.*\n\n**Summary:**\n \nWe are proposing that Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program. Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:** \n\nOlympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs while offering users discounted tokens in return. At the time of writing, Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity.\n\n**What are the protocol benefits of this new bonding mechanism?**\n\nFor the protocols there are a number of benefits. One of the primary benefits is creating a new revenue stream for the DAO. By owning the liquidity, the DAO will start to capture the trading fees. At the time of this writing the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nAdditionally, since there is no longer a need for extreme inflationary token incentives MANA will have a protected liquidity floor. This helps to protect from illiquid markets and creates a better trading experience for token-holders due to minimal slippage.\n\nFinally, the Olympus Pro program helps Decentraland gain exposure to the Olympus community! Decentraland and Olympus are two of the biggest communities in the Metaverse and DeFi industry. We believe it would be the perfect partnership to broaden both communities and to create a truly powerful decentralized ecosystem for both Olympus and Decentraland.\n\n**Motivation:** \n\n*What are the benefits for the community?*\nGives the community the opportunity to buy discounted (~5-10%) tokens in exchange for providing the protocol a liquidity position. This provides a truly positive sum interaction between the protocol and community. In typical liquidity mining the protocol pays out their token for individuals/entities to temporarily provide liquidity. With Olympus Pro the Decentraland still pays out it’s token but receives an LP/asset in return. A win-win for both parties!\n\nAdditionally, the community will not have to suffer through impermanent loss. Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair. With Olympus Pro they simply provide an LP position to the protocol and receive MANA in return! The MANA is linearly vested over a typical time period of 7 days - meaning the discounted MANA accrues over a 7 day period, and can be used freely at the end of this period.\n\n*How can it help Decentraland?*\nControlling Decentraland’s own liquidity will support sustainable growth and can create new revenue streams for opening reward emissions for its users. \nIncreased revenue streams for the further development of the protocol. For example, on December 6, trading fees on X for the ETH-MANA LP pair were $12,060 USD. If Decentraland owned the liquidity for this pair, these fees would go to the DAO treasury.  \nRemoves the need to create high inflationary rewards for liquidity mining \nAllowing multiple bond pairs with MANA (reserve or LP) would diversify your treasury, thus allowing for more complex DeFi strategies to create sustainable growth that is essential for these protocols to keep incentivizing users to play the game\nControlling your own liquidity decreases your dependency toward financial backing (VCs, private investors, etc) and gives more power to the DAO and its community\nThe tokens which Olympus earns as fees (3.3%) will never be sold and the community is willing to delegate the governance to entities voted on by the decentraland community\nPotential integration of Olympus within the Decentraland metaverse\n\nCurrent status of the Olympus Pro Program and it’s partners:\n\nWe have over 24 deployed partner projects on Olympus Pro with over 100 pending applications \nSome notable bond contracts which have amassed large amounts of total bond volume (TBV) are:\nAlchemix - $4.37M\nFrax - $1.97M\nPendle - $1.52M\nShapeshift FOX - $933K \nStake DAO - $877K\n\nOlympus Pro: https://pro.olympusdao.finance/\n\nA Beginner’s Guide to Navigating Olympus Pro: \nhttps://olympusdao.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-navigating-olympus-pro-5b1a9b710075 \n\n\n**Specification:**\n\nFor: Create partnership with Olympus Pro\n \nAgainst: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro","choices":["For: Create partnership with Olympus Pro","Against: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7426,"scores_total":531596.6442616633,"votes":21,"manaVP":21696.644261663332,"landVP":10000,"namesVP":73900,"delegatedVP":426000,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"b21e91f0-84f3-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmeJCjr2fSHgcTC5D3hv9chH2rZeNGfeKWYo1nZUrQ5LNw","user":"0x3098529f929c1ced32f06b8d3df47082597af7a8","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -91,-84 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2022-02-03T13:17:00.191Z","finish_at":"2022-02-10T13:17:00.189Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"x":-91,"y":-84,"type":"add_poi","description":"The Vienna Art Gallery is coming to Decentraland. \nEnjoy frequent Meet & Greets with our photo artists and painters. \nJoin our mixed reality events or just come over and enjoy the art.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":7413,"scores_total":506532.5254068667,"votes":10,"manaVP":44032.52540686676,"landVP":36000,"namesVP":500,"delegatedVP":426000,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"d6e15b80-84d0-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123","snapshot_id":"QmXxc9BLzcFvuVgFXEGoJwELpakEpjVS3W2spsamp4xzVd","user":"0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0","type":"poll","title":"Should Yannakis be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?","start_at":"2022-02-03T09:08:00.480Z","finish_at":"2022-02-08T09:08:00.478Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Should Yannakis be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?","description":"## Description\n\nWhile the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed.

The domain chosen is a big decision as it becomes part of that entities brand. There's a big difference in brand effect from being beer.eth(https://bit.ly/3o7UgWH/) to b33r.eth. I believe mana.eth to be a strong contender for ideal domain for decentraland dao.\nI believe being forward thinking and swift moving is this area is going to be massively beneficial. As the market begins noticing increased demand, like any piece of scarce digital property, the prices could be driven up quite high. I think that's why people have been willing to pay a premium to secure powerful/clean domains(https://bit.ly/3s3oP15).\nSomething I would just like to point out, that I don't think has been realized yet, is the power of subdomains. The dao would be able to issue everyone their own subdomain of their choosing (i.e. jack.mana.eth, sage.mana.eth, etc) which the person could then put in their twitter profiles and such to show their support of the dao - I believe this will become very common place in the future.\nWe're still very much in the nascent stages of ENS development. Only a few coins can be assigned an address but in the future you should be able to send any coin to an ens address, from any chain and layer. Right now it seems dao's are largely sleeping on the importance of a domain, but once again I think in the future nearly every dao will want one.\n\nAs the current owner of mana.eth, my motivations are obvious, but I also strongly believe in the future of digital identity that ENS is building towards. I'm hoping to reach those who also believe in that future and perhaps have a bit of influence in the dao and encourage you to light the fire in this area and get your domain secured - whatever you collectively end up deciding it to be.\n\nP.S. - I've just found the dao already owns dcl.eth that it uses on its backend for ingame name registrations I believe? Well if the dao doesn't wish to use ENS in a public way, that's its own decision. But if I had a strong position in the dao, I'm absolutely certain of what my preference would be - I would want mana.eth shown on the dao's twitter page, and I would want as many members putting their subdomain in their twitter profile(and other socials) as possible. And I would want it to look like jack.mana.eth  over  jack.dcl.eth - one is very clear support for decentraland, the other is ambiguous and would clearly need the acronym explained until its understood what it is.","choices":["yes","no","maybe in the future","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":7189,"scores_total":105014.39398805414,"votes":11,"manaVP":70514.39398805414,"landVP":32000,"namesVP":2500,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"51cae350-81fe-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb","snapshot_id":"QmbquFCDxLv3TJzvCKSEtMNPs7Lz18XdEKw5Y2nRZe2wZn","user":"0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99c698d4b1fe1aa0599346","type":"poll","title":"Should Wearables Including Guns Be Allowed?","start_at":"2022-01-30T18:56:00.558Z","finish_at":"2022-02-04T18:56:00.556Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Should Wearables Including Guns Be Allowed?","description":"Should Guns/Knifes attached to wearables be accepted.

We are very disappointed to see this being embraced so early in what was touted to be a censorship resistant environment.\n\nBeing offended is subjective so even the most innocuous names could be perceived as being offensive by any individual or group at any time.  E.g. Snowflake, Cracker, Yellow, Red, Brave, Monkey just to name a few.\n\nThe idea: Unban all banned names and switch to a user controlled ecosystem where each individual has the ability to decide on their own what they want or don't want to see similar to chat.  This gives users more control over their experience without anyone being subjected to or coerced by reddit/twitter style outrage mobs, while preventing endless future dao votes on the subject as people start to add or change characters over time to circumvent these blanket bans.\n\nWe believe this to be the most reasonable solution to restore censorship resistance and confidence within Decentraland while granting ALL users the ability to have control over who and what they want to see. If you deem something offensive all you will have to do is press a couple of buttons and it's no longer an issue.\n\nTo allow name banning in such a frivolous manner is to allow and reinforce prejudice by definition (not to mention the inefficiencies that come with voting and banning each name that someone happens to find offensive) As citizens of Decentraland, we believe users should be blocked and/or ostracized based on their actions; not what they refer to themselves as while also leaving the door open for any individual user to block any username/user they don't like without any time being wasted on feelings based votes and blanket bans that are far too often passed as a result of a single user having sufficient vp to get their way. This is neither healthy nor sustainable; the slippery slope is very real.\n\nThere are many recent examples that support our assertions. \n\nTo allow such censorship is to repeat the very mistakes blockchains intended to solve, thereby making it directly contradictory to the Ethos of Decentraland and cryptocurrency in general.

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform.

While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies. \n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access. \n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold.

They bring a bit of pizazz to DCL and make the world feel that much more alive. But all too often, events are completely neglected by their hosts -- people stay up late and gather around spaces, only to find that nothing is actually happening on the land. There are also many events that occupy top real estate on the events page for *weeks*, but the event has actually concluded ages ago.\n\nThis is very frustrating and while DCL veterans may tolerate it to an extent, I feel this is extremely detrimental to the growth of the user base. I've brought new people into DCL before for events, and because the event doesn't happen (either it's delayed or completely forgotten about), the new players get frustrated and never touch DCL again. \n\nI suspect some event hosts use the valuable real estate on the events page to market their products/services and don't actually intend on delivering the activities they promise. Who really knows - it's all conjecture. Nonetheless, I think users should have a way of upvoting or downvoting events so that hosts are held responsible for delivering quality experiences.\n\nTL;DR: Implement upvoting/downvoting system for events.","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":5922,"scores_total":416579.2351851777,"votes":15,"manaVP":8249.954862053199,"landVP":88000,"namesVP":5200,"delegatedVP":315129.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"b877ba80-75fe-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmdiZW9t6BQ9cex2zSbFLRZ4ftJNqQXyqSKEDSbvetm6be","user":"0xbda5d0f22bca7b0af635bd3efc720759d1c2dfb2","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Sarai","start_at":"2022-01-15T12:29:00.865Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T12:29:00.864Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Sarai","description":"kjhgiuyiyugvbyuidnfgmnfghmfhmhfmmjfhmth ,jh","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":5920,"scores_total":639967.0288856096,"votes":6,"manaVP":80253.74856248501,"landVP":240000,"namesVP":4600,"delegatedVP":315113.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"b292a260-75fe-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmQrmUPc9MKPdF6FtGjEyHpGoAPbjrUPHK2v6NfbVrVw7h","user":"0xbda5d0f22bca7b0af635bd3efc720759d1c2dfb2","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Sarai","start_at":"2022-01-15T12:28:00.974Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T12:28:00.974Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Sarai","description":"kjhgiuyiyugvbyuidnfgmnfghmfhmhfmmjfhmth ,jh","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":5921,"scores_total":403119.8409991393,"votes":4,"manaVP":1306.5606760147891,"landVP":82000,"namesVP":4700,"delegatedVP":315113.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"6ee04650-75f2-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmeVQQzr3PDaf5EpMnKz7D2w2zu5vSwJh1aCweXqZBUuNW","user":"0x0749d1abb5ca9128432b612644c0ea1e9c6cc9af","type":"poll","title":"Decentraland News Network?","start_at":"2022-01-15T11:01:00.437Z","finish_at":"2022-01-22T11:01:00.437Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Decentraland News Network?","description":"Do you think we should have a Decentraland News Network?

More details and specifications in the original [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) for Third Party Wearables.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nDefine a *fair* *slot* price (each Wearable needs one slot) for Third Parties to upload item representations of their NFTs and a *fair* *commission* *fee* for the Curators that will make sure these representations comply with Decentraland UI guidelines and aesthetics.\n\n**Specification**\n\nAfter the Third Party is added to the Third Party Registry as defined in the previous [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240), the Third Party Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and buy one *slot* for each NFT they want their community to have inside Decentraland.\n\nLet use an example: [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/) (or any other NFT Collection) may want their NFT owners to have a cool stoner hat that is only available for them, a wearable that represents their community and culture. So representatives from CCC could request the DAO to add them as an accepted Third Party to the Third Party Registry. This is the first step, then the Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and start the process.\n\nThe CCC Managers can add 3D models that will represent the stoner hat wearable, but in order to do so, they need to buy one slot for each model. If they only want to give their NFT Owners one single hat for each of them, then they need to buy just one slot. If they want to create a collection of many different models, they need to buy one slot for each one.\n\n\n**MANA collected from the slots purchases will got to DAO's Treasury and be used for:**\n\n- Curation fees for the Curators Committee\n- Cover storage costs for the 3D models\n\n**There are a few things to consider before setting the slots price and commissions:**\n\n- Price will be paid in MANA, but it will be pegged to the US Dollar.\n- Collections that were designed in a procedural way (this means that each 3D representation is created by using an algorithm like Bored Apes, Cannabis Club, etc) are not going to be curated individually. For example: if the collection has 10k [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), and they were created in a procedural way, curators will only review a portion of the Collection and review the process used to create it. If it is compliant, the whole collection will be approved. Curators will receive commissions for the portion of the collection reviewed.\n- If the collection was not created in a procedural way, every item has to be curated individually.\n\nThis feature, Third Party Wearables, implies a new way to get closer to **interoperability**. Many strong communities with valuable NFTs would be able to let their members enjoy them inside Decentraland.\n\n**Voting options**\n\n1. Slot Price: USD 300 / Commission for Curators: USD 50 \n2. Slot Price: USD 400 / Commission for Curators: USD 50 \n3.

Should this proposal receive 500K in VP, it will be resubmitted as a Draft Proposal.*\n\n**Question:** Should Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program? Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:** Olympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs (e.g. MANA-ETH) while offering users discounted tokens in return. Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity. One of the primary benefits of the Olympus Pro program is that it can create a new revenue stream for the DAO, by owning MANA-ETH liquidity and starting  to capture the trading fees. At the time when this proposal was written, the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nOlympus Pro is the partnership program of Olympus DAO.

That is, we enable NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, we will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that.","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85","description":"Currently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or  Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow. \n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi support users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform.

This is due to early adopters scooping up most of these premium/platinum names during the official launch in 2020. Lately I am noticing almost all new users with guest names. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is affordability due to requiring 100 Mana + Gas to claim a name. Another reason is most likely because the name they want has already been claimed by another user. Perhaps the last reason is name price on the secondary market is well above their threshold. \n\nHere is why I believe there should be a marketplace for leasing DCL Names:\n\n- Allow new users to experience what it feels like owning a name at 1/10th or 1/100th of the actual minting price.\n\n- Give someone the pleasure of having their dream name inside the metaverse.\n\n- Provide awareness, liquidity,  volume & activity in names market.\n\n- Incentive and passive income for anyone who owns two names or more.\n\n- Possibility for leasing names in L2 Polygon (Matic) with almost no fees. (technically may or may not be possible)\n\n- Great model for pop-up, one time events where that name is required or relevant for that event.\n\n\nLeasing options can be 1 day, 1 week, 1 month etc..

Also, each user will be able to manage a crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct financing from communities to creators.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers, producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","specification":"BeatBlox Muisc District:\n\nOur primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus of the BeatBlox expansion. We seek to develop an ecosystem that allows artists to create additional revenue and distribution channels, while enabling a more deep connection with their audiences. There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services. We are creating strategic alliances with music and blockchain fields referents for the development of user focused experiences and content. By doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland.\n\nCome and visit us at 40,44.\n\nBeatBlox Marketplace and Academy:\n\nBy using Polygon and reducing minting costs significally, we have succesfully implemented a NFTs sales and distribution system that allows floor prices as low as USD 1. We also gave birth to a concept in its entirety for our Decentraland district.\n\nIn this opportunity, we are reaching out to the community for helping us to strength the development, the promotion and the scalability of an integral platform. This will add value to users in the metaverse, while helping to reduce adoption barriers for new participants\n\nThis platform will be leveraged by a marketplace with expanded social functionalities, a curated catalog to ensure high quality standards and an Academy to support the adoption of new technologies linked to a further democratized access for artists and users to the vast opportunities that this technology provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","personnel":"Please refer to our documentation for a full description of our team, experience and background: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","roadmap":"Please refer to our documentation for a full description of monthly goals, short to long term vision and budget breakdown: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":4166,"scores_total":13328496.910774715,"votes":20,"manaVP":13052496.910774713,"landVP":274000,"namesVP":2000,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":"0x8a6dec7bcc3af9a1d1b5507ccbfab6ecc434ac0a","enacting_tx":null},{"id":"4c56bf10-63fa-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmeUJW48WkTSX79Sd9qEppTGgsoKJ3gqpNNuSTRUhjPbqF","user":"0x091fe9f3de121a09b5c2f3cffea0bc914458cb92","type":"poll","title":"Diverse languages should be supported in typing in Decentraland","start_at":"2021-12-23T14:12:00.537Z","finish_at":"2021-12-30T14:12:00.516Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Diverse languages should be supported in typing in Decentraland","description":"As a decentraland, there should be no boundary in languages\n\nNow only alphabet can be supported in typing in DCL.\n\nIf more different kind of languages are supported, more people from non-alphabet language speaking countries will get in and easily getting used to DCL.\n\nSo, I suggest non-alphabet languages like Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. should be supported in typing.","choices":["Yes, it's needed","No, it's not needed","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":4156,"scores_total":313571.5776857661,"votes":22,"manaVP":8973.802685766106,"landVP":150000,"namesVP":1700,"delegatedVP":152897.775,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"5eb0e350-637f-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"QmTWJHHGidLDrpiXqxHAkPwWngDBTFvjAAniWgqKHm7G3E","user":"0x2d4ba5f549c78c2e34aa8e1a3894c75e3d5f9150","type":"grant","title":"Dreamers Dream, Builders Build.

WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","description":"When creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.","specification":"Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU","personnel":"**The team**\n\n* **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n* **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n* **Lew Co-founder**, 3D artist\n* **maruudn**, Community manager\n* **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)**, 3D artist","roadmap":"**2022 Q1**\n\n* Server improvements\n* WonderZone NFTs\n* Shared meteors\n* New wearables\n* Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n* In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n* Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n* More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n* Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n* In-game Pets\n* More wearables\n* Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n* Restructuring of the park","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3868,"scores_total":13324438.083519965,"votes":237,"manaVP":9395154.137505237,"landVP":3380000,"namesVP":104900,"delegatedVP":444383.9460147345,"vesting_address":"0xe8a1B5F25b3bF789aFAe04f3F11C0e7d0F527973","enacting_tx":null},{"id":"7d204d10-5f3f-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"Qma3e7ECfYNPiyxXHVUdtPiQxVxX3AdatBEntDn58AB9JA","user":"0x46d8603959f92b0cff6d453c15c3bbfa945ee890","type":"grant","title":"Copywriter","start_at":"2021-12-17T13:44:00.849Z","finish_at":"2021-12-24T13:44:00.848Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Copywriter","abstract":"Looking for an excellent English/French writer to showcase your startups or product in Metavers?\nOr a quality Trader influencer on Instagram?\n\nHere is your happiness: Mr Passave Christopher , a 19-year-old commercial prep student, delivers his services to you on demand so that your nugget can be known at the four corners of the Metaverse !","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0x46D8603959f92b0Cff6D453c15C3BbFA945Ee890","description":"Hello, my name is Passave Christopher and I offer a quality writing and communication service.

As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2. \n\n\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"Byldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:\n\n1. Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\nByldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2. Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.","personnel":"### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

Proposals must meet specific criteria before they may be moved to the next stage. The end result is a binding governance decision.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCommunity “Polls” are the only mechanism at this time for the community to vote on complicated governance issues, for example, on issues surrounding voting power, fee structures, and other socio-economic dynamics. The poll category is designed to be a non-binding gauge of community perceptions, not a binding governance proposal. However, in response to community feedback, the DAO Committee has taken on the practice of implementing polls as policy, in the absence of a more formal voting mechanism.\n\nThis is problematic for three reasons. First, the poll format does not allow time for consensus building and adequate assessment of impacts and implementation pathways. Second, there are no restrictions on who can submit a community poll, leading to spam proposals and there are no voting power thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on voting power). Finally, because polls are non-binding, their implementation has become dependent on the DAO committee, undermining the efficacy of the DAO and confidence in our governance process. \n\nThis proposal aims to establish a three-tiered voting process that begins with a “community poll” in its current form, and ends in a binding “governance proposal.”\n\n\n**Specification **\n\nThe voting process will include three tiers: Pre-Proposal Poll, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds.\n\n***Stage 1: Pre-Proposal Poll***\n \nThe purpose of the Pre-Proposal Poll is to introduce a governance issue to the community, gauge community sentiment, and determine if there is enough support to move forward with the drafting of an initial proposal. Pre-Proposal Polls can only pass to the Draft Proposal stage if they have accumulated a threshold of at least 500K VP. A poll that reaches at least 500K VP and does *not* garner a majority of participating voting power, may *still* advance to the Draft Proposal stage - ensuring all issues with enough support have an initial pathway toward passage into policy.  \n\nPolls do not need to be composed in any specific form. They can be drafted in the full proposal format, or be presented as a straightforward question. Polls are currently the only option we have for governance issues that fall outside the established categories (Grants, name ban, catalysts and POIs).\n\n- Submission Threshold: 100 VP (i.e. equivalent to one name)\n- Passage Threshold: 500K VP\n- Voting Period: 5 Days\n\n\n***Stage 2: Draft Proposal*** \n\nThe purpose of the Draft Proposal is to present a potential policy to the community in a structured format and to formalize discussion about a proposal's potential impacts and implementation pathways. Draft Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 1), and can only pass to the binding Governance Proposal stage with a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power with a threshold of at least 1M VP. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time.\n\n- Submission Threshold: 1,000 VP (or delegated VP)\n- Passage Threshold: 1M VP\n- Voting Period: 1 Week\n\n\n***Stage 3: Binding Governance Proposal*** \n\nThe purpose of the Governance Proposal is to formalize the passed version of a Draft Proposal  into a binding governance outcome. Only established or recognized community members can submit Governance Proposals, which are only passed if they reach the needed acceptance criteria for their category. In the interim period before new voting categories have been established (and for proposals that do not have a pre-set category) a Governance Proposal must receive a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power and at least 6M VP to pass as a binding decision.  \n\nProcesses and thresholds for established categories will not be changed as part of this proposal. Meaning, the process for grants, POIs, etc… will remain unchanged. Additional categories for specific types of issues, e,g, “fee structures,” will be proposed, and relevant processes and thresholds developed. \n\nGovernance Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 2).\n\n- Submission Threshold: 2,500 VP (or delegated VP)\n- Passage Threshold: 6M VP (or needed acceptance criteria for their category)\n- Voting Period: 2 Weeks\n\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nDAO Governance should be agile and responsive, however, at the same time tempered and deliberative. In its current form, important community decisions are being made on a week-to-week basis, and through non-binding community polls. The proposed voting framework will moderate the pace of our self-government and facilitate a detailed and deliberative process to ensure we make informed and representative decisions.\n\n(Annex outlying Draft & Governance Proposal format provided in forum)","choices":["For (1): Establish a three-tiered binding Governance Proposal process","For (2): Modify current use of Community Polls, however, amend this proposal","Against: Do Nothing/Maintain current use of Community Polls","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3584,"scores_total":3584605.4397254265,"votes":39,"manaVP":916092.1594023021,"landVP":2268000,"namesVP":85400,"delegatedVP":315113.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"48d015f0-5bce-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174","snapshot_id":"QmdzCGj7GEQX6jjCGLo1CuzmKrN98u2GAnbMgubUhbXiyH","user":"0x11406a7317579bd4527f21f9ac5b5c46745a9706","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name Impossible","start_at":"2021-12-13T04:36:00.463Z","finish_at":"2021-12-20T04:36:00.463Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"Impossible","description":"The word “Impossible” shall not exist in Decentraland, merely this word is offensive to the foundation of MVR","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3569,"scores_total":835740.6949257237,"votes":33,"manaVP":110427.41460259924,"landVP":304000,"namesVP":106200,"delegatedVP":315113.2803231245,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"053ea670-5b61-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174","snapshot_id":"QmSFhCKUrQ1EUEP25XzZGkTP9rM9dzxac4GAYrQp1ucK36","user":"0x60d7ef00900ed962146b96b16e2df1036c9e09f2","type":"poll","title":"Allow users to also upload their own wearable to dress their own avatar.","start_at":"2021-12-12T15:34:00.960Z","finish_at":"2021-12-19T15:34:00.960Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Allow users to also upload their own wearable to dress their own avatar.","description":"Hi, I would like for users who can design their own wearables to be allowed to upload the files and dress their avatar ; Then these uploaded items COULD  or COULDN't be available for sale to others that can't design but love an avatar wearable which is not in the market place they can ask to purchase the item direct from user and not just from market place.

This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":2500,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","description":"Standard users within Decentraland (DCL) have quite a few resources on-hand to build a display to show off their NFTs, but all of them require a fair bit of work to. Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.","specification":"This module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land). I believe that enabling users to not only create but also share their content easily will be key to building up this platform.","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo, again :).

This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n \n**WonderZone NFTs** \nMany of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding. \n \n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**\nCurrently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them.

The majority of Decentraland being underdeveloped may be a result of land owners not having the skills or resources needed to develop the amazing experiences we all know Decentraland is capable of rendering.\n\nTo address the underdeveloped land and lack of high-quality user engagement zones, should the marketplace be expanded to match two new sets of market participants?\n- Match land owners  with renters\n- Match people who need DCL developers  with people who specialize in DCL development (modeling, blockchain programming, game developers, etc...)\n\nI think this is an easy extension to the Decentraland marketplace that would significantly increase the amount of development in DCL, which would increase the number of active members.

Each of these names currently has 100 voting power. If we reduce the cost of the names, does the voting power also drop? Does it drop just for those that claim a name for a lower price? If so, who will track which names were claimed at full price and which were claimed at reduced price to determine voting power? If the voting power is reduced for all names including those that were claimed for 100 MANA, then it will create an inequity in voting power distribution.\n\n2. Owning an NFT name is not a requirement for participating in any activities in Decentraland. It is purely optional. In fact, anyone can enter Decentraland and use any name of their choice at any time for free. It will just have several additional characters added at the end as an extension. Therefore, I question the need to reduce the price of names at all.\n\n3. It seems that virtually every day there are several names claimed for 100 MANA each. If people are willing to continue to pay 100 MANA to claim a name then there should be no reason to reduce the price.\n\n4. Many of those that claimed one or more of the 30,000 existing names for 100 MANA did so as an investment. These are NFT’s that have value. If the cost of claiming a named is dropped, it will completely change the value structure of these NFT’s.

I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven. \n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.","roadmap":"Beginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3215,"scores_total":1614235.5621311036,"votes":34,"manaVP":97278.1414551533,"landVP":1170000,"namesVP":23500,"delegatedVP":323457.42067595007,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"ebfe3f80-5350-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmXq2Y8JZDdegYPL1giTUokow5wfDzzK3MeSNEDb1hXa7a","user":"0xfa61a917133e27b5053fd4ae97e3910c9ca99f8c","type":"poi","title":"Add the location -48,103 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-12-02T09:19:00.344Z","finish_at":"2021-12-09T09:19:00.344Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":-48,"y":103,"description":"CollecOnline’s Virtual Gallery is an evolving space that features international artists, NFTs, real-world artworks, and collectibles.

(Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the [DAO's vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.\n\nAs of the time this proposal was published,  `34,857,497` of that MANA is now available to the DAO's treasury. At a current market value of ~150,000,00 USD.\n\nThe Treasury also has 5,392,411 USD in stable coins at the moment used to fund grants. The original proposal to convert 1/5 of the Treasury to stablecoins [was approved here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372).\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) specifies new grant tiers to be paid in stablecoins.\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n***In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/8th of its treasury (or  `4,357,187` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***\n\nThe remaining 7/8ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n#### Specification\n1/8th of the DAO's existing treasury, or  `4,357,187`  MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, in equal proportions. Using the current price of MANA (4.8 USD/MANA) this transaction will generate ~`20,914,498` USD\n \nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig using DEX protocols over a period of several weeks ensuring to get an average price and minimizing the impact on markets liquidity.\n\n#### For\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n#### Against\nReject the proposed asset allocation.","choices":["For","Against","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3192,"scores_total":11096784.05753136,"votes":65,"manaVP":8384126.636855407,"landVP":2228000,"namesVP":31100,"delegatedVP":453557.42067595007,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"c1aad530-525c-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmR3Dm7dEnydoLuthxpG9GE6Cfv8oCck75v1DE6Ps8NUNp","user":"0xc34bfc6519942fa1331766b0f107c2b382c4b9bc","type":"ban_name","title":"Ban the name loveleilei","start_at":"2021-12-01T04:11:00.132Z","finish_at":"2021-12-08T04:11:00.132Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"name":"loveleilei","description":"perfect perfect perfect perfect","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3183,"scores_total":766005.0641340746,"votes":31,"manaVP":49268.30914973455,"landVP":206000,"namesVP":93700,"delegatedVP":417036.7549843401,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"f1d3db10-524f-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmV9ELk5mBLspYLf7o2KMNVKyF8NRokWxMVZv4k69UYcQG","user":"0x0d021557dcc058b70beb430425d212ac1b541db6","type":"poll","title":"Age Limits Areas","start_at":"2021-12-01T02:39:00.474Z","finish_at":"2021-12-08T02:39:00.474Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Age Limits Areas","description":"Everyone knows that the younger generation now a days are very technically advanced and online.

Following the passing of the proposal, there was a duration of time before the fee change went into effect. This refund proposal would *only* affect wearables submitted during this period of 'limbo', where the changes were approved, but hadn't yet been enacted.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n*(1)* Establish a time stamp for when the approved wearable publishing fee adjustment went into public affect on the https://builder.decentraland.org/ domain\n\n*(2)* Determine which wearables were published at the original 500 MANA fee *after* the DAO approval on 10:13AM on November 7th, 2021 (snapshot below) and *before* the time stamp established from step (1)\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.dcl.eth/proposal/QmZ8DGYqLb8yVCmiN8XmnqyYu3BMw8bS23NJWQ2335PQQW\n\n*(3)* Calculate, audit, and issue credit back to affected creators for the price difference according to the newly-approved and implemented system applied to MANA prices at the original time of publication.\n\nFor example, if 2 wearables were published by Creator X on November 10th for 1,000 MANA and the price of MANA was $4 USD at that time, then the actual price per the enacted DAO proposal would be 125 MANA ( = $500 USD ) for each wearable. According to this math, Creator X should've paid only 250 MANA rather than 1,000 and would be eligible to receive a 750 MANA refund while still having paid the updated publication fee.\n\n**Purpose:** Why is this important to the Decentraland community? As an involved community member and creator myself, I understand the importance creators have on the growth of this fantastic community and social ecosystem. During this 'limbo' period, although it was no more than a week or so, many creators were dissuaded from publishing content knowing that the fees were going to be adjusted to a lower price.\n\nFor some, deadlines do not permit us to be selective about when we submit wearables for review, so for those that were negatively impacted by this short-lived situation, this would be appropriate compensation. Lastly, it should also be stated that this is a unique scenario and that few creators actually submitted during this time, so the total impact is relatively small making this a feasible proposal to take on and address.\n\nThank you kindly for your time and consideration ~","choices":["Agree to Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators","Do Not Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":3177,"scores_total":5567246.612818994,"votes":47,"manaVP":2345835.4014267907,"landVP":2754000,"namesVP":24700,"delegatedVP":442711.2113922022,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"2a4dbc00-520e-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmUhK6276Z5DLe1HUVVtoESdPKEVJr1VvrmaWNELZdoaki","user":"0xf3f1f5cc169b39d488341d8737f085a6c6be7316","type":"poll","title":"In Decentraland, should we make name plates 25% larger and name text 25% larger and yellow for minted Decentraland Names, so that they are more visible than the non-minted names?","start_at":"2021-11-30T18:48:00.440Z","finish_at":"2021-12-07T18:48:00.440Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"In Decentraland, should we make name plates 25% larger and name text 25% larger and yellow for minted Decentraland Names, so that they are more visible than the non-minted names?","description":"For those that have minted a Decentraland Name, I believe that the name plate in Decentraland should be more visible than the non-minted names.

This question comes up most often in relation to creating wearables or social media profiles.\n\nDecentralization and community ownership are core values of Decentraland, so user generated content is paramount.  In the spirit of supporting UGC and community ownership, the community should have clearer guidelines for when and how individuals can use the Decentraland name and logo.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n_Terms of Use for Decentraland’s Logo and Name _\n\nDecentraland is a decentralized virtual world governed by its users and as such strongly supports user generated content (UGC). People may use the Decentraland logo and name in their creations within Decentraland, but must follow the following terms.\n\n1. **Allowable Usage.** Users shall comply with these terms as well as Decentraland’s Terms of Use (https://decentraland.org/terms/) and Content Policy (https://decentraland.org/content/) in order to be allowed to use the Decentraland name and logo within Decentraland.\n2. **Logo and name ownership.** The Decentraland Foundation is the registered owner of the Decentraland name and logo, acting for the benefit of the DAO. This is because currently the DAO lacks formal legal status.\n3. **Wearables and user names in Decentraland.** Users may create wearables and names using the Decentraland logo and name on the Decentraland platform, provided that they don't violate the platform's Content Policy and Terms of Use. As far as the Decentraland Foundation is concerned, you are not prevented from monetizing or obtaining profits from the sale of said wearables or user names. The NFT must be unique in design. The Decentraland Foundation has the right to deny the use of the Decentraland name and logo at its sole discretion in any case and at any time.\n4. **NFTs and other uses outside the Decentraland platform.** The Decentraland Foundation does not authorize the creation of NFTs using the Decentraland name or logo outside the Decentraland platform. The use of the Decentraland name or logo is not allowed in other virtual platforms different from Decentraland or in the real world.\n5. **Disclaimer.** In all written materials relating to your product, including websites, publications, etc. it must be made clear that you do not have any kind of affiliation, business partnerships or other official association with Decentraland, the DAO or the Decentraland Foundation.\n6. **Press Releases.** Any press releases that you distribute through social networks, media or news services should clearly state that you do not have  any kind of affiliation, business partnerships or other official association with Decentraland, the DAO or the Decentraland Foundation.\n7. **Advertisements.** Any paid advertisement that uses the Decentraland name or logo is generally not allowed and must first be approved by the Decentraland Foundation or the DAO. To seek such approval, you can send an email to: legal@decentraland or through a DAO proposal.\n8. **The Name \"Decentraland\".** Subject to these terms you can use the name “Decentraland” to promote your game(s) or wearables as long as it doesn’t confuse consumers and as long as it is not used as the name of an app or any kind of merchandise or product. In other words, you can refer to “Decentraland” as the name of the platform, and you can use the name to show your interest in or affection for the Decentraland platform.\n9. **The Logo \"Decentraland\".**  Subject to these terms, you are only allowed to use the logo design that is available at the following URL: https://www.figma.com/file/pBiYuNALsSEFncGy3x6dIZ/DecentralandLogo?node-id=3162%3A117. The Decentraland Foundation or the DAO may alter the form of this design from time to time. You are allowed to resize the logo as long as you do not modify the proportions.

THE DAO AND THE DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE (IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION) WHETHER THE USE IS ACCEPTABLE.\n* (B) YOU MUST NOT USE THE DECENTRALAND NAME OR LOGO IN ANY MANNER THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REPUTATION OF DECENTRALAND (AS THE DAO OR DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION MAY DETERMINE IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION).

New users can find some content on YouTube, read through the SDK, and even find a set of snippets that display core use-cases (animations, transactions, etc); but we currently lack a set of larger, accessible projects which can be studied. Land owners also lack an available set of easily installed scene games, which provide valuable content, without purchasing such content through development teams or external sites.\n\nThis development grant seeks to target these two problems by providing a:\n- functional code-base that can be accessed by developers to further their understanding of DCL development\n\n- playable scene preview that can be easily accessed to show new users a small portion of DCL's potential\n\n- functional game that land owners can freely host on their land\n\nThis project is the first in a series I am planning on developing. I'm starting small, mostly board-games and old computer games, to create a start point for any new developer. However, I am aiming to implement larger projects such as tower defence and card games. By implementing these projects and providing them to the community we should be able to make things easier for new developers, stimulate land owners to develop their land with free modules, and attract new users!","specification":"The core design factor here is ease-of-use. The program will be created using modular design and a heavy focus on implementing interfaces. This means developers will be able grasp the high-level concept of implementation (how all the pieces fit together) and how each function works  (what the individual pieces do). This also provides users a way to add this game to their scenes without needing to have an understanding of programming.\n\nCheckers will be the game that this module will be centred around. Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene. This means a single scene could host several boards at one time, allowing for land owners to create plazas or hubs for users to play at!\n\nWhen completed, the code-base will be publicly hosted on Git so anyone interested can access/download the files. A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want. All rights to the code-base will be waived, pushing it directly into the community's ownership and allowing interested parties to do with it as they please (including hosting on their land/building upon the project/monetizing play).","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo, its a little too small to pull any teammates in. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the projects I've implemented and polished for DCL is Minesweeper, which is currently playable [here!] (https://vercel-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/)","roadmap":"The current estimate for this project is two weeks. During the first week I will implement the functional code and provide a preview of the game scene. By the end of the second week I will have polished the code to maximize readability and optimized the scene to run efficiently.

When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space.

The subreddit has almost 500k members and there have been over 100 books published covering Blender.\n\nAs a creator that's made virtual worlds and avatars across dozens of platforms (including Decentraland) I've used Blender for:\n\n- creating, fixing, and optimizing 3D models and avatars\n- converting between different 3D file formats (great glTF support)\n    - 20k meebits were made into usable avatar files using Blender\n- High quality renders, lightmapping, and animations\n- Exporting content directly to web based virual worlds\n\nFeatures include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.\n\nOne of the foundation's goals is \"to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core\".\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation\n\nBlender is GPL licensed, ensuring that the code will be free as a public good for all time. It protects the developer and user community from malicious patents, hostile forks, lock-down attempts, bait-and-switch-to-closed. Other software that is GPL licensed include the Linux kernel and wordpress.

However with MANA currently over $2 USD, paying 500 MANA upfront to submit a design is not possible for many creators.\n\nBy maintaining the 500 MANA fee the Wearables Editor becomes available only to established creators and others with deep pockets and excludes young and newer creators who cannot afford $1000 USD or more to submit a wearable.  \n\n**Limitations**\nHaving the wearable publication fee tied directly to fiat value would be complicated as value can change by a few pennies on any given day. Not only would this create a need for fractional MANA transactions, but it could have the unintended consequence of creators waiting for some ideal price to submit their designs.\n\n**The solution is to have a fee with a set value that is adjusted weekly.**\nAt a set time once per week, the wearable publication fee would be set based on the current USD fiat value of the token, so that the fee is approximately $500 USD rounded to the nearest whole MANA.\n\nThis would eliminate the need for fractional MANA transactions and would keep the value of the fee relatively constant. Any dramatic change in value is corrected by the next week, allowing the fee to remain relatively constant regardless of changes in the value of MANA.\n\n**Proposal**\nThis serves as a proposal to once weekly adjust the wearable publication fee so that the fiat value is approximately equivalent to $500 USD, rounded to the nearest whole MANA instead of a flat MANA fee. The Curation Committee’s compensation would be proportionally adjusted to remain at 10% of the fee.","choices":["Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee on a Weekly Basis to Reflect an Approximate Fiat Value","Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee at a Different Frequency to reflect an Approximate Fiat Value","Leave the Wearable Publication Fee at 500 MANA","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2652,"scores_total":2741905.4847106105,"votes":52,"manaVP":469470.3501175091,"landVP":1306000,"namesVP":28600,"delegatedVP":937835.1345931015,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"a3d8a710-3a67-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmZqngt1jBSYQ8NX8eabWAP5t1NiZcDJaFMfi56CDcSmjf","user":"0x739eb7914cd124d049d999c6f1874914af4f5337","type":"poll","title":"Should we have a way to automatically adjust prices based on exchange rate?","start_at":"2021-10-31T16:28:00.657Z","finish_at":"2021-11-07T16:28:00.657Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Should we have a way to automatically adjust prices based on exchange rate?","description":"With the recent spike in the exchange rate of MANA many reasonably priced items are now absurd.

It is our experience that documenting our creative process and making video tutorials is helping to make onboarding easier and build community in DCL. \n\nIn addition to tutorials, we are networking. We have successfully used applications, giveaways and events to reach new artists, collectors, and crypto users who have entered and utilized the benefits of Decentraland. \n\nWe have submissions from 18 countries in our gallery. They are, in order of number of entries: United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom, India, Denmark, Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon, Japan, Romania, Philippines, Malaysia, Nepal, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Italy. \nWe host recurring weekly events in Decentraland, such as Mermaid Tarot Readings and Heros and Dragons game. \nWe have a global music event coming in October ‘21 featuring DJ’s from around the world, NFT and POAP giveaways, and participatory modules.\nWe have events planned with our cryptocurrency partners such as Polygon, Shiba Inu, and BAO. \n\nWe plan to continue our community-building education and entertainment efforts and have reached a point where we must scale our project in order to meet the level of interest. We must improve accessibility in order to create seamless delivery across social channels and within our complex in Decentraland. It is important that all who wish to access these offerings can do so easily and have fun while they do! \n\nWhile we're excited about the pilot results, it is also clear that to offer the content we envision will require a team committed to consistent effort, and more resources. Our goal is to keep growing the Decentraland community through ease of accessibility, education, and fun events.

Let's change the protocol and open new doors.","description":"Hello, everyone. Today I want to talk about a thing that is stopping the progress of Decentraland events. This thing is latency on streams.\n\nWhat I mean is that every time someone tries to stream inside a screen there are many seconds between the real world and what the screen shows. Inside DCL, it's usually about 20seconds or more depending on the server and where is the player located.\n\nI have seen that this thing makes events less enjoyable. For example, if there is a streamer and you talk in the chat of DCL, you need to wait a lot until that person responds/interacts with you.\n\nIn this sense, events that depend on streaming are very slow. Most of the players will end up following the stream via Twitch or YouTube (if the event manager is also streaming there) and it kills the experience.\n\nRight now, I want to make new events with cool ideas but those events depend on streaming and it's quite impossible to do it with 20+ seconds of delay (most of the time is 40seconds).\n\nI think this problem exists because of HLS which is the protocol Decentraland uses. From what I have seen, it is good in terms of compatibility but latency sucks. There are other options available such as WebRTC, RTMP and more. I don't know what could work with DCL but I think we need to change this.

The idea of the flower shop that is so much more than the ordinary flower store comes from the cult Italian comic book Alan Ford by Bax Munker and Magnus. Flowershop is run by Ultramono, an art laboratory for the production of cybernetic art. Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants. Using poaps, tickets, wearables, works of art, and creating workplaces, Flowershop will expand the ecosystem of the emerging new economy in art production within Decentraland.","specification":"Project will be executed in stages, first being the actual building of the venue. Models of the building already exist, so this is going to be a process of optimization and adjusting the initial sketch so it can be fully functional on Decentraland platform. After the initial stage of building and setting up the base, we will start with developing individual modules and governance of the Flowershop, and work on a multiyear programme of exhibition, party, and conversations programme, and define curated and conceptualized exhibitions. We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue. Flowershop concept is the idea of self sustainability, so extra special attention will be devoted to having help with facilitating the financial management of the space so both the programme will continue and all involved could receive compensation for their contribution to the programme.","personnel":"Ultramono is founded by a new media artist Tanja Vujinovic (https://www.tanjav.art/) who has produced and participated in hundreds of IRL and online events in the field of arts and culture.

Web3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects like [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/), there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.\n\nThe following solution would require third-parties (i.e. original creators of an NFT project) to apply to the DAO to be “registered” within Decentraland. Approved third parties would be added to a Third Party Registry (TPR): a smart contract deployed to Polygon.\n\nThird-parties would then be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs in Decentraland. Items should still be vetted by the Wearables Curtation Committee. All approved items would then be logged in the TPR with a unique identifier (URN).\n\nThis solution requires some work from the third parties. Each would have to build a “resolver” mapping their NFTs to the corresponding items in the TPR. This resolver would need to expose a standardized API endpoint that a Decentraland client could call whenever a player opens their backpack.\n\nThe mapping between NFTs and item URNs is up to the third party. For example, since the resolver is built by the third party, the response to the Decentraland client could be customized to return one URN for an NFT, or one URN for multiple NFTs. \n\n**These third-party representations of \"source\" NFTs would be different from current Decentraland wearables:**\n\n* The publication fees should vary depending on the size of the collection.\n* It would be impossible for these representations to be exchanged (in either a primary or secondary sale) in _any_ marketplace _independently_ from the source NFT. These new items are only 3D representations of the source NFT, and do not have their own corresponding token that can be traded.\n\n**Specification**\n\nFirst, some quick definitions:\n\n**Third Party**\n\nThe original creator of the external NFT.\n\n**Source NFT**\n\nA specific NFT within a collection of external NFTs made by a third party. For example: CryptoKitties, Apes from BAYC, etc.\n\n**Item**\n\nThe asset, or in-world representation, for a source NFT. These are identified in the TPR by a unique identifier (URN).\n\n**Collection**\n\nA collection of items that all belong to the same theme of NFTs. (e.g. apes from BAYC) \n\n**Item Slot**\n\nOne of a limited number of potential representations that Third Parties may use. Item slots are bought in tiers for MANA. \n\n**Third Party Registry (TPR)**\n\nThe smart contract deployed to Polygon that stores the list of approved third parties and the items that represent their NFTs.\n\n**Third Party Resolver**\n\nAn API built by a third party that allows clients to verify which source NFTs are owned by the player and which item representations correspond with those NFTs that can be rendered in-world. \n\n**Process overview**\n\n**Application phase**\n\nThird-party NFT projects propose the addition of a collection to the Decentraland DAO. These DAO proposals should have their own category within the governance dApp, and they should have a minimum threshold of 1M VP voting in favor (similar to grants) needed to pass.\n\n**A voting period**\n\nDAO members should be able to vote on whether or not to include the new third-party collection. The voting period should last 1 week, like other proposal categories.\n\n**Collection registration**\n\nApproved collections are added to the TPR deployed to Polygon. This is done by the DAO Committee.\n\n**Collection management**\n\nAfter a collection is approved by the DAO and registered in the TPR, the third-party may add, edit, and manage items within the collection. All of this management will be done via a new UI exposed in the Builder available to approved third parties.\n\n**Purchasing item slots**\n\nPart of the collection management stage is the process of buying item slots for a collection. These slots can be purchased in batches in exchange for MANA.\n\nThe size of the batches and price function should be determined in a separate proposal.\n\n**Item approval**\n\nLike all wearables, items must be reviewed and approved by the Wearables Curation Committee. Items must be “locked” by the third-party before they can be approved by the curation committee. As collections of third party NFTs might include thousands of items, members of the curators committee should be permitted to sample specific items before approving items in batches. It would be unrealistic to review items individually.\n\n**Item registration**\n\nAll items are uploaded and edited by third party managers (addresses given “manager” permissions in the Builder) before they are added to the TPR. Items added to the TPR are then reviewed by the Wearables Curation Committee. \n\n**Deployment**\n\nWearable models and textures are uploaded to the catalyst network after ensuring each URN has been added to the TPR. This results in an address check either via a subgraph or a check to the TPR contract itself.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThird parties are responsible for developing their own API endpoint mapping their NFTs to the item URNs in the TPR. This endpoint’s shape should follow a predefined standard to avoid one-off integrations. Furthermore, the logic behind this endpoint and any interaction with other smart contracts would be outside the scope of Decentraland’s involvement. Full legal responsibility lies with the third party to ensure that they only interact with smart contracts whose IP they’re permitted to use.\n\n**For a visual overview of the collection creation, approval, deployment, and resolution flow [see this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znwxC35wg6kzksvqP3pCMiJ2D-DwgtF3/view?usp=sharing).**\n\n**Additional comments**\n\n* While this implementation could support any form of asset, the first use-case is wearables for avatars based on PFP NFTs.\n* The goal isn’t to make external NFTs compatible with Decentraland, but to create new representations within Decentraland that are linked with external NFTs.\n* The Curation Committee is responsible only for approving _items_ submitted by third parties. The DAO would approve the addition of new third parties.\n* The Curation Committee always has the ability to reject specific items, all items within a collection, and all items from a Third Party creator should the resolver provide incorrect data, or no data at all, to the client\n* Items won’t exist inside traditional wearable collections, won’t have rarity, and cannot be sold in primary or secondary sales. They are only in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the TPR.\n\n**Should the suggested implementation for wearable representations of third party NFTs be developed by the Foundation?**","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2392,"scores_total":2835909.164565985,"votes":121,"manaVP":85193.22456598391,"landVP":2102000,"namesVP":78800,"delegatedVP":569915.94,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"5d2ae1f0-2b8c-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmV7C32KWtSCDAk4p5m6BYey2yWfxz6thG2hwakNYwrTzH","user":"0xedce8440c3665a0affbf2e686d32a8d02ff361e4","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 88,-14 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-10-12T18:44:00.015Z","finish_at":"2021-10-19T18:44:00.015Z","required_to_pass":500000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":88,"y":-14,"description":"Penguinclub is a community project where multiple people spent a lot of time in organisation and building over last few weeks already.

I look forward to creating relationships with those I haven’t met already in DCL!","roadmap":"In Phase I,  provide introductory tours and fully onboard 3-4 either creators/brands/celebrities.  Onboarding includes a drop and drop party in DCL.  That is our goal between now and March 2022. \n\nIn Phase 2: Outreach to schools in the creative arts (think Parsons School of Design) and help with introducing them to the space, providing an eventual Student Mentorship program (Phase 2 by end of May 2022)\n \nPhase 3:  If I can find a space to host us,  or if we end up being able to buy a space in DCL to create this:  A “gift shop” type of experience after our very first tour!  Featuring wearables and art we found along our tour.  (Think: high quality Museum gift shop like theMOMA). \n\n** LATE PHASE POSSIBILITY: Conferences and/or Events planned for the benefit of our artist/technical community and a DCL Kid Creator Fashion Show of all the wearables that came into the space during this time plus our Kid Collabs!!  Get ready ladies and gentlemen, we want to show you what collaboration between kids/students and established creators can come up with !!    (Planned for Q1 of 2023) \n\nI’m so excited about the initiative and I truly hope we can receive funding to make this a reality.

Since then 12 grants have been given for Content Creator, Platform Contributor, Gaming and Community categories.\n\nThe current structure is aimed to single individuals:\n* Tier 1: One-time payment of $500 - $1500 USD in MANA\n* Tier 2: One-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA\n* Tier 3: Up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff.\n\nThis proposal aims to create 3 new tires designed for teams and larger scoped projects.\n\n### Motivation\nThe current tires are good to fit small projects and individual contributions. If more money is needed the contributor can continue requesting further grants to keep up the good work (eg. KevinOnEarth).\n\nIn order to tackle bigger projects that require the commitment of a team for many months we need to scale our tire options. This will attract more talent to the ecosystem.\n\n### Specification\nThe proposed new tires are:\n* Tire 4: Up to $60.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n* Tire 5: Up to $120.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n* Tire 6: Up to $240.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n\nThese tires allow a team to receive up to 10k, 20k or 40k per month for over 6 months. The amounts represent the maximum requested value per tire and it opens the possibility to request less money, for example with Tire 4 one could ask for 3k USD per month over 6 months.\n\nIt’s recommended to teams to start with small tires, get idea’s validation from the community, show some progress and later request a bigger grant to suit the escalation of operations. It will be quite harder to get DAO approval for a massive grant to an unknown team.\n\nTeams should report progress to the DAO Facilitator which will be included in regular reports. The grants are provided via revocable vesting contracts, thus enabling the DAO to cut a program that doesn’t deliver what was promised.\n\n### Benefits\nThere are many ways the DAO benefits from the success of grants:\n\nFirst, if these grants add value to Decentraland’s ecosystem then MANA should get more general awareness and the price should go up, thus making the treasury of the DAO bigger. So what is good for Decentraland is good for the DAO.\n\nSecond, I would love to see projects capable of generating a revenue stream, becoming profitable ventures, and generating employment around Decentraland. Enabling more people to make a living out of Decentraland’s ecosystem is key.\n\nUltimately, bringing new people on board with skills and mindsets it’s a great benefit for the DAO. We need more active members. Attention and initiative are scarce resources IMHO.","choices":["Approve the inclusion of Tire 4, 5 and 6","Do not approve the inclusion of Tire 4, 5 and 6","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2332,"scores_total":9827738.757303925,"votes":132,"manaVP":8578622.817303926,"landVP":672000,"namesVP":7200,"delegatedVP":569915.94,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"e3bc30f0-2724-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmS2sHaud8qqNrz194QMfm2MUGonWB8koZCFStAk82KhUY","user":"0x47742612d1e3e75bf777110977c8e4a53d84fd7b","type":"poll","title":"Should the default view mode be changed from Day mode to Night mode?","start_at":"2021-10-07T04:13:00.471Z","finish_at":"2021-10-14T04:13:00.471Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Should the default view mode be changed from Day mode to Night mode?","description":"When logging into Decentraland users start in the Day visual mode.

Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months. The Foundation would provide a roadmap to the DAO to review, provide feedback on, and approve on the same 6 month schedule to help communicate to the community the Foundation’s strategic and technical priorities.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n* Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n* Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n* Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n* Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics\n* Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users\n\n### Background\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:\n\n**The “DAO”**\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of the platform’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**The “Decentraland Foundation”**\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community. \n\n**The “Decentraland Stack”**\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the _Decentraland Platform_. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as: \n\n1. The **smart contracts** that make possible Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like land, estates, wearables, names, etc.)\n2. The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3. The **software development kit** that people use to build content for the world.\n4. **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for the world without writing code.\n5. **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.\n6. **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself.\n\n**The “Reference Client”**\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is a web based app that allows people to access and interact with content and other people within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform - those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Duration and renewal of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule.\n\nThe Foundation would be responsible for writing each 6 month iteration of the roadmap, but each iteration must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**Ideation and validation for the roadmap**\n\nThe DAO must have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n**Deviations from the roadmap**\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements, but these departures must be later approved by the DAO as part of the biannual schedule.\n\n**Funding development**\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n**Termination of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n**Limits of the delegation**\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform (e.g. changes to the Marketplace’s smart contracts); any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued  development of the platform.\n2. The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n3. Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n4.

This has been mentioned  [in the docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/the-dao-fund/)  and  [in the blog](https://decentraland.org/blog/platform/community-funding/)  before, but many may not be aware of it.\n\nThe DAO has a lot of resources and a thriving community but lacks executing power. We need to invest more money and time in building infrastructure for Decentraland’s DAO.\n\nAt the moment the DAO has 4 teams:\n* Security Advisory Board: 5 people to address security risk.\n* DAO Committee: 3 people to enact proposals on-chain.\n* DAO Facilitator: 1 person to produce reports and organize meets.\n* Wearable Curation Committee: 3 people to review applications.\n\n\nThis proposal aims to create a new team with the mission of developing new software.\n\n### Motivation\nAt the moment the DAO is supporting contributions in the form of grants aimed to individual contributors. As an open-source project we rely on external contributors, being The Foundation the most active contributor.\n\nThe Foundation team has ~45 people working under their wing, they have been doing an amazing job and brought us a great decentralized platform and a world explorer to enjoy it.\n\nBut in order to accomplish the wider goal of becoming a more capable and powerful DAO, we need to take action. We need to onboard new contributors to help build Decentraland’s ecosystem. We need to create our own teams capable of executing the vision of the DAO.\n\nWe can start by speeding the development of our Governance dApp. This app is a critical piece of software for the DAO and it needs to be well maintained. It's also a small project in terms of scope, which makes it a great place to start.\n\n### Specification\nA team of highly capable full-time contributors will be assembled, filling the primary roles of Team Lead, Product Manager, Technical Writer, Web Designer, Solidity and, frontend dev.\n\nThe main scope of this team will be:\n* Become core maintainers of the Governance dApp.\n* Automate key processes of DAO’s operations.\n* Research proposals in order to enrich conversations.\n* Build new dApps to support community use-cases.\n\nThe DAO will set a budget and formally delegate the Governance dApp to the team. The team will be free to work on ideas that make the conversation in the governance more fruitful. The team will report their progress and consult their roadmap with the community.\n\nThis team won’t be focusing on contributing to projects already maintained by The Foundation (eg. client, builder, marketplace). If they do, they will be treated by the maintainers as regular open-source contributions.\n\nA list of things to work on the Governance dApp at the moment:\n* Automate generation of reports.\n* Replace Aragon's UI to ease DAO Committee operations.\n* Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.\n* Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.\n* Add a Members' page listing current teams and members.\n* Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.\n* Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.\n* Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.\n* Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.\n* Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.\n* Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process\n\nFunding a team to work primarily on the Governance dApp will produce faster development than relying on individual contributions because of their capability of shipping cross-cutting features. \n\nThis is a push to boost Decentraland’s ecosystem. We’ll start with one piece by building a team to improve it. If this strategy proves successful we could build more scoped teams to maintain and build other projects.\n\nThe point of this proposal is to reach a consensus that the DAO should begin the process of forming its own dApps team. The details of how many members, what their roles are, how much they are paid and how often, and how the DAO can oversee their work should be covered in a separate proposal(s).\n\n### Vote\n* **For**: Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n* **Against**: Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","choices":["Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2150,"scores_total":816079.7444548393,"votes":20,"manaVP":97443.3094548393,"landVP":266000,"namesVP":10400,"delegatedVP":442236.435,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmNeyrR9dqMkdgL4PexpLNp1LiqNX252ZgdFfQX3YRuNCg","user":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","type":"poll","title":"Reimburse gas fees to DAO Committee Members","start_at":"2021-09-17T21:41:00.844Z","finish_at":"2021-09-24T21:41:00.844Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Reimburse gas fees to DAO Committee Members","description":"### Summary\nReimburse gas fees spent by DAO Committee Members when enacting transactions for the DAO.\n\n### Abstract\nThe DAO Committee is responsible for sending on-chain transactions in order to update Decentraland’s Smart Contracts.\n\nEverytime a votation about Catalyst, POI, Ban and Grants passes, we send two transactions to the Aragon’s DAO contract in order to enact the proposal. The first transaction creates the action on the DAO and we have to wait 24 hours before we can send a second transaction to execute it. This delay period was included for security, during that time the action can be paused by any DAO committee or SAB member.\n\nThese two transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. The fee is extracted from the wallet sending the transaction, the DAO Committee Member’s wallet.\n\nThere are other cases in which the members of the DAO Committee also spend gas, for example deploying vesting contracts and transferring the ownership of them to the DAO. Some polls may also require the Committee to take on-chain action which incurs in gas fees.\n\nThe addresses of the DAO Committee are:\n\n* 0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc (Yemel)\n* 0xBef99f5f55CF7cDb3a70998C57061B7e1386a9b0 (HPrivakos)\n* 0x3323B7264F7D5e8f98e6aFCcec73b6bA1116AE19 (Eric)\n\n\n### Motivation\nI’m the one who has sent more transactions in the group.

Note that I only use this address for my DAO Committee role.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nThis proposal is to allow the monthly reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members. The reimbursement will be calculated by the DAO Committee and the operation will be noted in the next bi-weekly report.\n\nThis might only be necessary as a temporary stop-gap measure. In an ideal scenario, DAO Committee members shouldn’t be paying gas costs nor doing manual accounting tasks.

This name now reads surprise.kinder. You can see it from this link below\n\nhttps://app.ens.domains/name/surprise.kinder 3\n\nRight now this name is a token only. For it to become an ERC721 NFT a new smart contract will need to written. This will make it usable within the Decentraland platform.\n\nWhy this proposal is important?\n\nMany existing and new platforms and projects are now coming into DCL. Decentraland Metaverse is an excellent place for brand recognition, awareness, adoption, marketing, advertising. It even works for individuals and small teams.\n\nSlowly we are seeing the formations of guilds, groups, teams, friends, families, fans and much more. The idea behind this new proposal is only the make things more fun, exciting while adding another utility to names.\n\nEach event is just getting bigger and better with more players coming in. The most recent CocaCola event was totally epic. So I thought to my self wouldn’t it be fun if the CocaCola team members all had names? for example imagine they are named diet.cocacola, zerosugar.cocacola, vanilla.cocacola and so on. Straight away you would know who the official representatives are because of their name. Many other example can be given. However it does not have to be a company or a business’s. It can be fan based groups. Let’s say a group of females are super into Bratz and they can have the names meygan.bratz, yasmin.bratz and cloe.bratz.\n\nSubdomains can be minted directly from ens domain website. Although all the names are NFT’s the subdomains on the other hand are only tokens. For the subdomains to become NFT’s a new smart-contract has to be created.\n\nThis will allow all subdomains to be easily used, transferred, traded just like any other NFT\n\nMain usage for dcl subdomains\n\n- Guilds, Groups\n- Friends, Families\n- Businesses, Brands\n- Platforms, Projects\n- Games, Events\n- Giveaways, Prizes\n\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/create-a-new-smart-contract-for-decentraland-names-subdomain-s-to-be-nft-s/1850\n\n\nPlease vote \"YES\" or \"NO\"","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2083,"scores_total":3160367.7122397264,"votes":42,"manaVP":303977.802239726,"landVP":2114000,"namesVP":300200,"delegatedVP":442189.91,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"9485f870-114b-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","snapshot_id":"QmaG188qwu7FwneATFPH4PEKSUky43WK4zc3ETJ6RUY56V","user":"0xfce9b76ae84c176b51988219f1e822c241706640","type":"poll","title":"should there be an option to save favourite locations?","start_at":"2021-09-09T08:54:00.368Z","finish_at":"2021-09-16T08:54:00.368Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"should there be an option to save favourite locations?","description":"I think we all need this one...","choices":["Yes","No","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2069,"scores_total":837185.7364604027,"votes":30,"manaVP":199893.62646040277,"landVP":452000,"namesVP":58100,"delegatedVP":127192.11,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"35e10620-1015-11ec-853d-5ff6f49b5cff","snapshot_id":"QmQDThG3LhCWCdWH4LSUAvKV5mgXzr2t3v2L1hrv4RQZQo","user":"0x5a659a97dfbd423a8824d472c879135b7e6c2227","type":"poll","title":"Enhance flexibility for wearables creators in collections","start_at":"2021-09-07T19:53:00.595Z","finish_at":"2021-09-14T19:53:00.595Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Enhance flexibility for wearables creators in collections","description":"As it stands today, wearables creators must publish the entirety of their collection at once. There is no ability to add to it after it's originally been published.  For any creator trying to bring new items to market on a regular rhythm - versus all at once at the beginning - this leads to a bad consumer experience, as the newer wearables must be created, approved and published in a new collection with a different name. \n\nCreators should have the ability to flow newness into their existing collection over the course of a year, thus creating excitement with avatars/players and a reason to revisit a shop/marketplace.  Imagine:  sneaker drops from your favorite creator 4x/year or apparel creators launching t-shirts and jackets on a seasonal basis,  all under a single, easy to shop collection taxonomy.  In other metaverses, the artist has the ability to do this.    \n\nThis proposal specifically is to enable artists to manage their collection by adding items over time instead of the collection being locked in upon the initial mints.  To be clear, the proposal calls for the same DAO item-level approval as happens now.  This is decidedly NOT a proposal asking the DAO to grant approval on the first items and then carte blanche ability for the artist to do whatever they want in the later ones.   The DAO will still maintain approval at the item level, and artists will revert back to the DAO when ready to extend their lines of product.  This change would simply allow artists to choose whether to publish in a separate collection or to add to their existing, likely master, collection.\n\nUltimately, it is DCL players that benefit as they will be able to more clearly track newness and shop from artist collections they prefer.  Plus, the marketplace browsing will be less cluttered.   As it stands today, many artists have multiple collections - upwards of 10 - and to scroll through these takes time for the shopper.  Allowing an option of a single master collection will streamline browsing and buying for DCL consumers.","choices":["Allow wearables creators to add new items to existing collections, assuming DAO item approval","Do not allow any new items to be added to existing collections, even if DAO has approved the item","Invalid question/options"]},"discourse_topic_id":2057,"scores_total":942358.2489472312,"votes":26,"manaVP":347868.33894723136,"landVP":136000,"namesVP":16300,"delegatedVP":442189.91,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"84a87790-0e92-11ec-a5a8-05cb7ba30f57","snapshot_id":"QmTVLN8Q2ANAabyFoHU3i2SBZS3D3eZTGS4P345ysLCw2o","user":"0xeaff5dce42db9cc5fa6efe2e6bd926b8017386fc","type":"poll","title":"Inverting the y-axis of the mouse","start_at":"2021-09-05T21:44:00.530Z","finish_at":"2021-09-12T21:44:00.530Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"passed","configuration":{"title":"Inverting the y-axis of the mouse","description":"Various amounts of games allow the y-axis of the mouse to be inverted in the settings.

Diversification of DAO funds: CryptoPunks NFTs value is steadily rising and as liquid as cryptocurrencies. So investing in such assets increases the DAO fund stability. It is equivalent to buying GOLD.\n\n3. Free Advertising: Since VISA acquired one of the CryptoPunks there is a lot of attention towards NFTs especially CryptoPunks. This could help in grabbing more media attention and private investor which would accelerate the growth of Decentraland.\n\n4.

Use includes deployments, transfers, marketplace listings (including unfulfilled), and the owner of the account signing into the marketplace.\n\n\n* **Lost Assets**: LAND and/or ESTATES held by an account where the associated private key has been lost. Does not include LAND or ESTATES transferred to an account through accident or theft, or LAND that has been abandoned.\n\n\n* **Claimant**: a user with claim to Lost Assets.\n\n### Abstract\n\nA user who has lost access to a private key and therefore to all LAND and ESTATES held by their account must have a way to present her case to the DAO in order to regain control of her Lost Assets. The DAO can not use this procedure to reclaim abandoned LAND. The DAO can only use this procedure to recover Lost Assets owned by a user who has lost their account’s private key.\n\nThe claimant needs to present evidence beyond reasonable doubt about the incident to prove herself the rightful owner of the lost account. The case will be published on the forum and will be reviewed by a Judicial Committee to ensure it complies with _the requirements (see below)_.\n\nIf the case is approved by the committee, the claimant will be granted permission to **deploy new content** on the Lost Assets owned by the lost account but **won’t be able to transfer the LAND and ESTATES for a period of time (12 months)**.\n\nDuring that period of time, the lost account and the DAO will retain the power to revoke deployment permissions of the claimant. After that year the claimant will be able to transfer their assets freely.\n\n### Motivation\n\nPrivate keys will be lost and some users will fail in their efforts to protect their assets. In case of loss, if enough proof is presented to the DAO the rightful owner should regain access to her LAND and ESTATES tokens. See [Ethen’s case](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/vote-yes-to-return-lost-land-and-set-the-precedent-for-this-moving-forward/296) as the first example.\n\nToday it is technically possible to make a secure setup to overcome the loss of a key. For example by granting co-ownership to a second account or a multisig shared with friends. \n\nHowever, given the current undeveloped state of the user experience for Ethereum, Web 3.0, and cryptocurrency in general with regards to advanced key management schemes, this kind of setup requires high technical knowledge from users.\n\nThis proposal aims to help those who fall into misfortune by providing a last hope, a journey to recover a lost account.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe ERC721 standard defines the concept of approvedForAll; ​​an owner-wide role that can transfer any ERC721 of the owner, and also set UpdateManager roles. [See roles recap](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/a-recap-land-ownership-deployment-permissions/12).\n\nThis proposal requires updating the LAND and ESTATE smart contracts to add a mechanism that allows the DAO to set the co-owner of a lost account.\n\nThe update will be a new method on the registry that allows the DAO to set the approvedForAll role to an arbitrary address.\n\nThe new co-owner will be a smart contract that will function as an escrow of the assets first giving the claimant permission to update land and estates and after twelve months the claimant will be able to transfer the assets.\n\nDuring a period of twelve months, the lost address and the DAO will keep the power to revoke the contract, an action that will return the LANDs and ESTATEs to the original owner.\n\nThe proposed changes to the LAND and ESTATE Registry are [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/pull/152/files). The intermediary contract is still pending and an external audit is still required.\n\n\n### Application Requirements\n\nTo kick off this process the user needs to present her case publicly on the forum including all evidence possible. The case will be reviewed by the Judicial Committee.\nFollowing a proposed guideline of requirements:\n\n* The “lost” address must have a minimum of six months of inactivity.\n    * Specifically, no executed transactions by this wallet, either signing or sending txs.\n    * If the claimant has received anything inadvertently, this is not an indication that they have access to this wallet (air drops, scam coins, etc. )\n* The user provides a description of how the key was lost.\n* Objective proof of ownership, some examples are:\n    * Private messages signed with the “lost” key.\n    * LAND description linking to claimant’s personal info.\n* Two witnesses testify on behalf of the user (over video).\n    * Character witness: Familiar with claimant’s cripto-goins (friend, work colleague).\n    * Expert witness: Developer or Community Member with technical experience.\n\nUltimately it will be the Judicial Committee's decision to approve or reject the application. In case of doubt (by any member) the application will be rejected.\n\n### Judicial Committee\n\nThe three recommended committee members proposed alongside this new implementation are:\n\n* Carl Fravel - Technology Executive, Member of many DCL districts.\n* Peter Derrick - DCL “Bartertown” estate owner and long-time contributor.\n* Yemel Jardi - Software Engineer and early contributor to DCL.\n\nIt is suggested and proposed that these committee members remain active for an initial period of 6 months before opening a poll to replace or renew them.\n\n### Main Concerns\n\n**Can the DAO reclaim abandoned LAND?**\n\nNo, this proposal does not address the issue of abandoned land, this is for future consideration.\n\n**Is this too much power to the DAO?**\n\nThe process needs to be started by the claimant and the decision is made by the Judicial Committee. The DAO should not use this method for other cases without a formal community vote.\n\n**How can the DAO prevent fraud?**\n\nThe address must be inactive for a period of six months and in case of approval, the claimant won’t be able to sell the land for a period of a year, giving time to the presumed “lost key” to appear and stop this process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n* Form the Committee but don’t upgrade the contracts. Give the DAO a budget to buy land and return it to the claimant.\n\n* Upgrade the contracts but don’t form the Committee, just let the DAO to judge case by case.\n\n* Do nothing to help users that lost keys and handle the land as if were abandoned.\n\n### Vote\n**For**: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Against**: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Other**: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal and publish a revised version.","choices":["For: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets","Against: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets","Other: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal."]},"discourse_topic_id":1921,"scores_total":4545689.1179043455,"votes":42,"manaVP":571269.0879043458,"landVP":3390000,"namesVP":41500,"delegatedVP":542920.03,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"f97ebc10-0450-11ec-bf2e-8bc0e796957b","snapshot_id":"QmUTQNfA9fNC9CLFAZuH11e9rrJzgS2CZyHEkRZ3NPe6Ai","user":"0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406","type":"grant","title":"Continue Video Editor for The Decentraland Report","start_at":"2021-08-23T20:30:00.138Z","finish_at":"2021-08-30T20:30:00.138Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Continue Video Editor for The Decentraland Report","abstract":"As our previous Approved Grant, we would like to continue to produce content for Decentraland and request funds. this time to produce 36 more videos \n\nThe previous grant requested funds for 10 videos, from which we were actually able to produce 20 videos, releasing 2 videos per week. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmnqSRvd6bbJgmlS6A8BNw\n\nWe would like to ensure we can continue to publish content twice a week for the remainder of the year (18 more weeks in 2021, total of 36 videos)\n\nAs the previous grant, we would request $50/video, which equals $1,800 in MANA.\n\nThank you for continuing to support what we do at The Decentraland Report to record and publish the story we are creating together!","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA","size":1800,"beneficiary":"0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406","description":"In our last grant we requested grant funding to cover 10 videos for The Decentraland Report, this was to be over the course of 5 weeks.

However, the initial tiers are insufficient for larger scope projects. Meanwhile, projects like [Decentral Games](http://decentral.games) were born out of a larger grant that gave them the resources to create an MVP attracting angel and institutional capital. \n\nThis new tier would use the DAO to fund pre-existing teams building play-to-earn games in Decentraland. Many such teams exist, but it's up to the DAO and the community to attract them to the platform through funding, support, and guidance.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThe most engaging scenes are mid-sized games. Without a clear path for small teams to finance and launch an MVP of their project on Decentraland, the talent will flock to other metaverses.\n\nDue to the success of Axie Infinity, many teams want to build play-to-earn games. Decentraland is well-equipped to host these, with a fully-fledged SDK, a vibrant community, and an integration with Polygon enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers of digital assets.\n\nWith a small investment, the Decentraland community could give rise to numerous games of the caliber of [WonderMine](https://wondermine.wonderzone.io/), Decentral Games, and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/).\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\n**The new grant category would consist of:**\n\n* $30k USD (in MANA) / month, for 3 months\n\n**What are play-to-earn games?**\n\nThis new tier may only play-to-earn games. The MVPs must:\n\n1. Be an interactive game\n2. Feature on-chain assets (fungible and/or non-fungible tokens)\n3. Give users the ability to earn on-chain assets by playing the game\n\nAfter 1.5 months, recipients should provide an MVP: an interactive scene with a functional play-to-earn mechanic. The DAO will review these MVPs, voting on whether or not to execute the third payment.\n\n**Mentorship**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could curate a list of mentors who would be able to coach recipients through the grant’s duration.\n\n**LAND**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could help pair recipients with LAND owners.\n\n**Applications**\n\nTeams will use an extension of the existing DAO grants form to apply.

After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\n          The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.","specification":"This is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well.

This will allow Creators to expand existing collections within their 'brand' without having to plan and create every item within the collection beforehand.

Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1. City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely “wired“ from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2. Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3. User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

Each land or parcel could host different boards, levels and tracks. We could build stadiums where we congregate to watch. DCL members could form leagues, for example Tuesday night Goldeneye league where teams of 4 have already paid their league fee, say 100 mana for 8 weeks where the teams compete for prizes (NFTS, crypto) . Audience members can wager on the outcomes. Additionally individual users can wager crypto against each other whenever leagues aren't active. High scores can be dominantly displayed for bragging rights but also as a challenge to others. I also believe that this  will lead to a NFT explosion as they would give you an actual perk/powerup in the game. for example say a skull shifter on your kart in the race that give you a banana every lap. this makes a very prominent USE case for NFTS beyond looking cool.

character\n\nHolders and investors are incentivised to display this asset in its best light and not in a way which devalues their investment asset with other non-fitting parts.\nThe character was built initially as one complete merged build on a single rig, after this would not fit on the current wearable format model I broke the character up into sections with each cut having equal weight per vertex, it fits and moves perfect together as was intended.\n\nI was told to wait until the “full suit” option is available. Previously as advised - my character was broken up into sections to fit the wearable option limitations - lots of extra work has been done on these sections individually on their own rigs and to go back to a complete (merged) version would require a much older version of the character and too much extra work to get the build to its current form. The broken up parts had a lot of refinements done on them\nThe character is a little heavy and will only be in mythic category for a high price\n\nI have done a lot of testing in Decentraland and everything works as it should - 4 are reserved and the owners will agree to not wear the suit more than 1 set per event and never combined with other wearables as they will not fit well and will clash with the style and theme, this theme is part of an even greater story and growing concept I wish to work on for many years into the future, I have pages of concept work and creative writing and sketches and many deep thoughts on the fantasy surrounding this, as well as years of my life in building out these scenes with a backlog of various 3d scenes I have built.

(Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the DAO's [vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding  decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO. \n\nAs of the time this proposal was published, `30,578,217` of that MANA has vested, and is now available to the DAO's treasury.\n\nIt is risky for the DAO to keep only MANA (its native governance token) in its treasury. To help guarantee that the treasury's balance remains wisely managed, the DAO's treasury should diversify across bluechip assets (e.g. ETH or BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI or USDC), and other assets such as a DeFi index (DPI) which may enable the DAO to earn yield. \n\nSpreading the DAO's holdings across these different assets will help to stabilize the DAO's entire treasury in the face of market fluctuations.\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community, e.g. grants. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) specifies that each grant is to be paid in MANA, according to the exchange rate between USD and MANA at the time of the transaction. \n\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n_**In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/5th of its treasury (or `6,115,643` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI. **_\n\nThe remaining 4/5ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n**Specification**\n\n1/5th of the DAO's existing treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, with to the following distribution:\n\n* `2,038,547.66` USDC\n* `2,038,547.66` USDT\n* `2,038,547.66` DAI\n\nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig, requiring the signature of all three members.\n\n**For**\n\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n**Against**\n\nReject the proposed asset allocation.","choices":["For","Against"]},"discourse_topic_id":1368,"scores_total":5734416.390545501,"votes":18,"manaVP":2204416.3905455014,"landVP":3530000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"69061530-de48-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372","snapshot_id":"QmYjaKUA8WQams4SQzpsgY8MNTvua3gLeobjQD1GbsSU83","user":"0xeb277c1eee99139d7ccb9b9bf4e9002ab7ab4ebf","type":"poll","title":"Land Ownership Titles","start_at":"2021-07-06T10:53:00.595Z","finish_at":"2021-07-13T10:53:00.595Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Land Ownership Titles","description":"you agree to implement distinctive titles for landowners.\nfor example :\n1 Land - Lord\n4 Land - Knight\n10 Land - Baron\n25 Land - Duke\n100 Land - Emperor\n\nThe avatar could carry the name, its title.

I feel that NFT's and images symbolizing various tribal groups often found within the blockchain environment  ( BoredApes anyone ? ) will become even more pervasive overtime, 2 days ago sandbox had a 24x24 landsale of over 830k usd shattering all previous records and the game isn't even out really, it is fast becoming a serious competitor.  \n  So aside from what i've said, i understand people will be against clutter on the map, so my proposition is to only allow users to upload an image to the world map after they have combined an estate equal to or in excess of 2x2 and that pictures would scale according to the following pattern 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc. ) this will be an obvious driver to the economy once people are keen to begin collecting several parcels of land and brandish their Logos in the metaverse, and last but not least.. with so much of the metaverse being tied to NFT's, isn't using an NFT( just an image ) as the main advertising medium an obvious conclusion? I understand that there will be issues with user generated content that will require a small amount of administration ( often explicit material is filtered by bots and never uploaded by bad actors so i believe the threat is low, and worst case scenario the dao will act accordingly in the future ).

There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.  \n\nSummary of work:\n\n* Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox\n* Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature\n* Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed\n\n#### Demo / POC\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74","description":"Full Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md\n\n\n### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items  \n\n\n##### Trigger Types\n\nIncludes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square\n\nI want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n\n##### Text Displaying Types \n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.  \n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.  \n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here \n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n* Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n* Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n* Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","personnel":"I already have one successful approved grant with delivered content.

The poll received **68% (4,322,367 VP) voting YES** (in support of VP delegation) and **32% (2,065,731 VP) voting NO** (in opposition to VP delegation). [You can view the original poll here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=fc6f60a0-bdb5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)\n\nHowever, due to the subsequent debate within the community, the DAO Committee recommended postponing the activation of VP delegation to allow for continued discussion. The Committee also called for the creation of a summary of the pros and cons of VP delegation to help inform voters leading up to this second, and final, poll in the DAO deciding whether or not to activate VP delegation.\n\nPlease carefully review this [report on the potential impacts of VP delegation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idxYsKqnpwH5IuwiCNE5Wu3AwXqGTNzilyqjK5M-S5Q/edit?usp=sharing) before casting your vote.\n\n**Specification**\n\nActivating VP delegation in Decentraland’s Snapshot Space would allow users to delegate their voting power to any address in one of two ways:\n\n1.

I want to share it all.\n\nAs of yesterday, I've released an early build of the tools for the community - https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53","description":"You'll be able to easily:\n- Place good looking (and performant) highlight boxes\n- Add holdable/intractable items that will make GAME making so much easier\n- Animate UIImage and UIText with ease. fadeTo, moveTo, scaleTo, ect.\n- Inventory system for displaying details about your holdable items\n- Storage system for placing entities into containers easily\n- Debug tools for placing items in the game, instead of saving and refreshing often\n- Audio/Video sound GUI for your parcel users to adjust volumes for individual audio sources.\n- Experience bars that animate when the value is updated\n- Much much more.\n\nRequests for common problems can be added to the github issue queue for my repo. I'm slowly adding in all of the things I've built. This obviously takes a large amount of time, and I'm doing it for free. Please consider this proposal. What I have already provided should benefit the community already, with some extra mana funds I'll be able to purchase some more land for testing out more interesting experiments which will also be rolled back into the community library I've created.\n\nPlease visit farm (DecentraFarm) to see many of these elements working together (It's still a work in progress obviously)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=0%2C-1&realm=unicorn-blue\n\nAlso visit my comedy/bar venue (TheBlock) - (Also a work in progress)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=-18%2C-122&realm=unicorn-blue","specification":"I'm going to set up a semantic version control for the project very soon. Other contributors can submit pull requests to help strengthen the util library as a whole. I will maintain and update it regularly with whatever I build.\n\nVisit https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeV8zMwwclJX7Bf-JdxdJxw\nto see whats coming. Tutorial videos will be included for each component, as well as detailed documentation about implementation.","personnel":"Patmacs - I'm very active (maybe even annoyingly so) in the #SDK discord channel. I have over 20 years experience in web development, 18 years professionally. JS/TS, APIs, React, Blender, Photoshop, Solidity, ect. I've done it all probably. Hit me up in discord to test my knowledge/experience on a specific topic.","roadmap":"Over the next few weeks I'll be moving a lot of the code from DecentraFarm into TheBlock in anticipation of a formal grand opening.  This will be done by first adding each feature to the dclconnect npm library,  documenting the process, recording videos, and implementing them into the venue. This process drastically extends the release of my own venue. However, I believe it's worth the effort, if the community can find these tools useful.\n\nThe feature list is included in the Description.\n\nA second phase may include another batch of components/entities that are specifically requested by the community. It may require an additional grant to develop. I'm not quite sure yet.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1297,"scores_total":1459494.7801319598,"votes":38,"manaVP":1029494.7801319604,"landVP":430000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":"0x78b311f4BE9969C41931aDA45d6eC53Bf54998Cf","enacting_tx":null},{"id":"87a5a860-d994-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b","snapshot_id":"QmSYP5zuFyLYz7vjefeUW8S35iuUCSAqnENFFcjh8iKX6e","user":"0x119e6f4644651e77eeb7031f4988ba29346d9608","type":"grant","title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","start_at":"2021-06-30T11:15:00.910Z","finish_at":"2021-07-07T11:15:00.910Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","abstract":"I am going to be hiring a \"Life Coach\" that specializes in assisting people to prepare and finalize their TEDx.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.  \n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in. \n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.    \n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.","specification":"This project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.  The approach will be to utilise what is already available before building anything new.  \n\nThe University District and its already established structures such as Decentraland University and Learning Spheres, will make for a suitable location to run this event, though some additional development is foreseen as necessary. \n\nA small research study will be performed to identify the feasibility of all existing reusable resources for this event.  The outcome of the research study will report a detailed plan of implementation using agile and iterative development methodologies.  \n\nNecessary modifications and additions to scenes/features will be developed through the Decentraland SDK and 3D modelling software (such as Blender).

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control \nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) \nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.  \n\n##### Scene Add/remove\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here \n\n[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.

The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1194,"scores_total":1198561.1450458097,"votes":36,"manaVP":876561.1450458096,"landVP":322000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":"0x14790738ee100309cd7038d17b289292b2109af7c0d18aa40d9095f9827d3264"},{"id":"d0a802a0-d378-11eb-987d-410735a966ad","snapshot_id":"QmcEtXsQLg9nY3ACAPFivBrHMTZo1KpKF1niFsJYrF5Br6","user":"0x6411a6771684e0b8535b57e64fb81d1a7facea07","type":"grant","title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","start_at":"2021-06-22T16:42:00.514Z","finish_at":"2021-06-29T16:42:00.514Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","abstract":"I want to start a youtube channel, of motor biking, showing the beauty of North-east India.

So what do you do?\n\nWell, since name NFT owners have passed a vote to get voting points and landowners have voting power privileges - Why do wearables owners not have that?\n\nThe only reason that I can think of is that future L2 wearables minted on MATIC may be minted for a very low cost per NFT so those would not be a great measure of how invested their owners are in the game. This would incentivize spam wearables just to get VP. So that is out of the question, - for now. Future L2 MATIC wearables will not be included in this initiative.\n\nBut ETH Layer 1 wearables have a fixed supply (except for a few rewards still outstanding) and are well distributed across the community. Every wearable you own today is an L1 wearable.\n\nWhat if owning those would give you additional voting power?\n\nAfter all most of those were purchased, like names and lands. And those that were received as rewards prove active participation in the game and that should be worth something.\n\nYes, certain larger entities will gain some additional VP, too. But I believe the wider distribution of VP among the regular folks in Decentraland would increase the will to participate in the DAO and would better represent how invested someone is in the metaverse.\n\nI would suggest to first decide if we want that and then have a second poll on how to tier the system based on the rarity category of the items.\n\nWhat do you think?

Currently, all of the LAND parcels that make up public roads within Decentraland are owned by the Decentraland DAO. Only the DAO has the permissions to deploy content to these parcels.\n\nBy authorizing an externally owned account (EOA) operated by the Decentraland Foundation to become an \"update manager\" of the DAO's LAND and Estates, the Foundation would be able to deploy content and experiences for everyone to enjoy.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nEnabling the Decentraland Foundation to deploy content to public road parcels provides several benefits:\n\n* Public events are increasing in popularity, boosted by the content built by the Decentraland Foundation. These events help to grow the Decentraland community and to build awareness and excitement for the entire platform. Increasing the LAND available to the Foundation would increase the reach and impact of these events.\n* Specifically, the Decentraland Foundation is hosting a Pride Parade in June to celebrate and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people and communities. As with physical Pride Parades, Decentraland's parade should be held on public roads. The Foundation needs access to these parcels to deploy the floats and decorations for the event.\n* In addition to events, the Decentraland Foundation can use these deployment permissions to keep public roads up-to-date with interesting and engaging content.\n* An example of another feature that the Foundation could deploy on roads is a tram system linking the major areas of the map. This tram system has already been built, and only needs to be deployed to public roads to make it available. [A demo of the tram system can be seen here.](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/DCL-trams/blob/main/README.md)\n\n**Specification**\n\nAssign an EOA owned by the Decentraland Foundation with the address `0x462ab09f1a75786E0c54ced394E0fB537Af03734` \"update manager\" permissions for all of the DAO's LAND and Estates.\n\nOwnership of these parcels would be maintained by the DAO, and the deployment permissions may be revoked from the Decentraland Foundation at any time via another vote in the DAO.

After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.\n\nHowever, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.\n\n**This introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:**\n\n* A high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators\n* The Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform\n* When exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered\n* Other dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users\n\nGiven the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. *This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.*\n\nThis fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.\n\n**These fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.**\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* Disincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published\n* Promotes the submission of very high quality wearables\n* Protects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables\n\n**Specification**\n\nEach time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item. These fees are charged per item in a collection, not per NFT minted from an item.\n\nFor example, if an X MANA fee is approved by the DAO, the fees would be as follows.\n\n* 1 Unique item - 1 NFT - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Mythic Item - 10 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Legendary Item - 100 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n* 1 Epic item - 1000 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA","choices":["100 MANA","500 MANA","Other"]},"discourse_topic_id":926,"scores_total":6194760.090970972,"votes":74,"manaVP":2092760.0909709735,"landVP":4102000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"b7b295c0-c154-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301","snapshot_id":"QmYTGE2N2YJu3hKUVabvwuPUUdoYbc9xytUjiEX2u2fgqm","user":"0xa5e2bb97de3c62ca06f1a2293eb7e01c114e9a49","type":"poi","title":"Add the location 26,9 to the Points of Interest","start_at":"2021-05-30T14:38:00.828Z","finish_at":"2021-06-06T14:38:00.828Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"x":26,"y":9,"description":"Add The Free TON HQ, built by DC Metaverse Studio as a point of interest in Decentraland.\n\nFree TON is a blockchain platform created by the developers of the Telegram Open Network (TON).\n\nLearn more https://freeton.org/discover","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":907,"scores_total":549459.9691990549,"votes":11,"manaVP":159459.96919905496,"landVP":390000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null},{"id":"39ace280-c045-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301","snapshot_id":"QmSaMCEwE9nx4uBeSpJk4aG6gxFeDF1ADbAodntRy3Tenw","user":"0x95a40112c37d79f6833935ec780495d5d3e23178","type":"poll","title":"Transfer Ownership of MANA-BNT Bancor Pool to the Bancor DAO","start_at":"2021-05-29T06:15:00.784Z","finish_at":"2021-06-05T06:15:00.784Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Transfer Ownership of MANA-BNT Bancor Pool to the Bancor DAO","description":"The Bancor DAO is looking to raise the Co-Investment limit of the MANA-BNT pool to open up space for LPs on the MANA side to stake their tokens single sided with Impermanent Loss Protection.

With that being disclosed, lets get to the details!\n\n**PROPOSAL**:\nNAME owners receive 100 VP per name owned. Just as MANA holders receive 1 for 1 VP per MANA, NAME holders (who put their MANA to work and also burn it out of existence) should receive 1 for 1 VP proportional to the cost of minting a name.\n\n**BACKGROUND**: \nCurrent DAO participants are MANA holders and LAND holders. LAND owners being granted 2,000 VP per land and MANA holders a 1 for 1 VP per MANA. As it shows, NAME owners currently hold no VP even though contributions to acquire names are arguably the most contributory to the state of Decentraland between the 3; minting a name requires the cost of 100 MANA (which is burnt out of existence!) as well as gas fees, which we all know can be outrageous at times. \n\nI will spare you all the argument of whether or not the minting cost of names should be lowered or not, but I will point out that compared to acquiring LAND, minting a name is dirt cheap. Not only does owning a NAME differentiate you from the flurry of \"User#1fj49\" Metaversers that populate Decentraland, but it is also a domain name -- which can be attached to a parcel (and a 1/1 NFT)!  I am not proposing this question as a means of adding extra utility to make my name investments sell better, but rather give those who do not have thousands of MANA to acquire LAND and also wish to have a unique identity in the next frontier of the internet, a say in how Decentraland progresses.\n\nGiven the recent major developments from the Decentraland dev team in how the DAO operates, I believe it will serve the community well to allow more members to participate in the direction of Decentraland. Since I joined the community a few months ago, I have learned that Decentraland is filled with so many helpful people -- whether it be a newcomer who has a plethora of questions, an up and coming NFT artist who is debuting their work, I have seen more examples than I can count with my fingers of instances of community members going out of their way to show support!

The goal is to ensure that grants have the scope, goals, planning, and appropriate funding needed to be successful.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nOne of the features to be added to the Decentraland DAO is community grants. These grants will use MANA owned by the DAO to help fund teams and/or individuals who want to create features or content for Decentraland. However, it is important to allocate the DAO's MANA judiciously for several reasons:\n\n1. The DAO's MANA fund is limited\n2. There are limits to what can realistically be built within the Decentraland platform\n3. It is common ground that it is in the community's best interest to maintain the ability to fund a range of projects over a long period of time\n\nTo maximize the impact of the DAO's funds and to ensure the DAO gives funds to projects most likely to succeed (thus adding value to Decentraland for the entire community), grants should be constrained in size and category to make it easier for the community to review and vet proposals.\n\n**The proposed grant categories are:**\n\n- Community\n- Platform contributor\n- Gaming\n\n**The proposed initial grant tiers are:**\n\n- $500 - $1500 USD in MANA, one-time payment\n- $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA, one-time payment\n- $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, up to a 3 month vesting contract with a one month cliff\n\n**Specification**\n\nFor a full description of this proposed Grants Framework, [please see this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDzmJTiDmr2rhIbSABUmuag0_poddC7tt192M-3ZitA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**For**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation will implement these grant categories and tiers into the DAO proposal submission process by means of pre-designed forms. Only grant applications within the above described framework will be funded through the DAO.\n\n**Against**\n\nDo not use the grants framework described in this proposal to limit funding provided to projects through the DAO.
