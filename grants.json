To emphasize this idea we’ve decided to run the event on two platforms simultaneously, in Decentraland a massive neighborhood would be developed specially for this event and from there you could teleport to a new world in W3rlds to explore even more amazing spaces. \n\n- huge exhibition space in two metaverse platforms\n\n- architectural competition open to creators with any experience\n\n- more than 20 pavilions by the creators from all over the world\n\n- expositions by well-known architects and designers\n\n- lectures and public talks \n\n- thousands of amazing people to meet during the event\n\nThe event will consist of several pavilions designed by well-known architectural studios such as Atrium, SpacesDAO, SA lab, Illusor, Dewans and others as well as emerging designers selected by a contest. In addition to this there will be lectures, discussions, NFT-exhibitions, art-installations and more, so anyone with interest in architecture and design could enjoy the event. \n\nMANIFESTO\n\n\nWe believe that as graphic designers have created the internet we’ve been using for the last decades, the Metaverse would be created by architects and designers.\n\nThe tittle of Biennale \"Presence of the future\" refers to the name of the first Venice Architecture Biennale - one of the greatest events to celebrate architecture and design. \"Presence of the past'' was actually the name of the 1980 Biennale directed by Paolo Portoghesi who has managed to organize an event of global significance bringing together great architects from around the world.\n\nNowadays, more than forty years later our perception of the world and design approach have changed dramatically, digital design tools became the main instruments and created a totally new language and, some might say, in our society and culture Postmodernism has been replaced by Metamodernism (whatever that means after the word Meta has become a brand).\n\nAll in all, \"Presence of the future\" aims to recall the power of architecture to reinvent the modernity and formulate the new quality of life in the immersive virtual space. In the moment when we are witnessing the creation of a new game-changer in the way we communicate, entertain and collaborate we challenge the architects and designers to envision our future in the built form and take the responsibility for it. We believe that this exhibition would bring the life-changing power of architecture and design to the metaverse and would set up a new positive vector for its development.\n\nOPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS \t\n\n1st stage: open call for submissions\nCandidats will send 3 visualisations of 3d-modeled architectural object reflecting the theme of the Biennale “Presence of the Future” and 200-500 words description of the concept. The jury would rate all projects by several criteria such as concept, formal / spatial complexity, atmosphere (use of light, textures, landscape). The function of the space is not limited: event hall, showroom, maze etc.\t\n\n2st stage: finalists projects realisation\nAll finalists are guaranteed to receive a grant from the organizers to produce the final spaces for the event.\t\t\t\t\nAll submitted projects are checked by the technical team and placed on site of the event prior to its opening.\t\t\t\t\nOn the final day of the event the jury announces the best project of the Biennale, its creators are invited to become the jury of the next event.","specification":"ALREADY CONFIRMED STUDIOS\n\nAtrium is global internationally recognized architectural studio with more than 25 years of experience working on projects of different scale and typology from urban design projects to boutique interior spaces, recently they've launched their own product design studio and metaverse spaces production. https://www.atrium.ru/\n\nSA lab is an up-and-coming company, focused on architecture in the digital age.

Players can choose to train a variety of skills, create tools, forge armors, and combat creatures. The game will feature a range of different environments, including a city, forest, farm, dungeons and more, each area coming with its own unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nLogs, ore, and food, as well as crafted items like swords and armors, will be tradable in a player driven economy.  Players will also be able to interact with one another in other meaningful ways like questing, game-wide events, and seasonal activities. This will create a sense of community and social connection within the game and encourage players to form long-lasting friendships and alliances.\n\nExodusGBW has proven itself to have a growing and active player base, consistently appearing as one of the most trafficked scenes in DCL.  Exodus's seasonal events, like its 2022 Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas events, provide consistent content as well as an opportunity for players to gather with each other while gaming during the holidays.  This, in addition to consistent updates to gameplay and the Exodus scene make the game engaging as well as playable for hundreds of hours!\n\nBeing an MRPG, Exodus places a focus on allowing players to own items they earn in-game.  As such, NFTs and blockchain technology are often integrated into gameplay.  As an example, Exodus has minted thousands of Decentraland wearable Santa hats as rewards for its currently ongoing Christmas event!  ExodusGBW will continue to take providing players the opportunity to own NFTs earned through gameplay as one of the most important aspects of being an MRPG.\n\nWhile providing consistent content for players, Exodus also provides opportunities for interns.  Its senior engineers and designers are happy to mentor and train students to be part of the team.  ExodusGBW is proud that its most recent interns have become productive members of its engineering team who are also capable of producing playable content.  Exodus intends to continue providing such opportunities to expand the educational outreach of the metaverse and DCL.\n\nTo conclude, ExodusGBW is a MRPG with a proven track record of shipping engaging content, promoting community involvement, and providing educational outreach and opportunity in DCL.  ExodusGBW focuses on allowing players to own NFTs through fun and re-playable content.  This grant is focused on supporting the continued development of Exodus in DCL.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration in reading this proposal.

Each of the six ships has an origin story with a legendary captain and a unique item of power.  For the Decentraland themed adventure, the crux of the story would be that the crew of the six ships enter Decentraland after being told that their Item of Power has been stolen. They are now tasked with retrieving it! Pirates will be given six clues, each clue leads to a separate location within the world.  Once they solve the clue’s riddle and reach the intended location, they will be met with a small treasure hunt.  Shards of the item of power will be scattered across that location. Once all shards are found, a kiosk will appear, and after entering the correct password (told to them by their Captains in Clipper Community) they will be granted with an NFT wearable that represents the item of power.  If a pirate is able to solve all six treasure-hunts and collect all six items of power, they may return to the starting point and retrieve a SuperUser reward.\n\nOur most recent adventure (Nov-Dec 2022) had [30,000](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999329098851684422/1041701754007474276/image.png)  user signups.

Regular signups were free, and even still we had an early-access sign up week, where we sold 5,000 early access tickets for $10.  We sold out of those in 12 hours.  We expect that we should have similar numbers for a joint event in Decentraland.  Even with one quarter the level of enthusiastic participation, we would see 7,500 web3 native users signing up for the Decentraland event.  7,500 Web3 native users sent to Decentraland and have them explore over the course of weeks, enough time to build habit and become long term users.  7,500 savvy users x $1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = $7,500.  We expect this CAC to be variable. If fewer come, the grant would pay less money.  If more come, the grant would increase to cover those members.\n\n*Adventures require enormous effort from the team at Shipyard/Clipper. During the month long Adventures, nearly half of our team of 12 works on these events full-time. And it doesn’t include the work spent in advance planning and developing.

This is usually due to the lack of some key functions, for example\n\n- Virtual currency (or score) system which is the foundation for long-term game experience\n\n- In-scene NFT rewarding system that makes sure players can get rewards without the need to send wearable or NFT rewards person by person\n\n- Dynamic pricing system controls the difficulty of obtaining rewards that helps to maintain the traffic\n\n![62](https://i.imgur.com/QZKW0Ad.png)\n\n- The development of their underlying layer that supports the above functions.\n\n![61](https://i.imgur.com/mOL4hZl.png)\n\n**What’s next?**\n\n**1/  Upgrade our experience and invite more brands & larger traffic**\n\n**2/ Package the core technologies that we’ve developed and create a Traffic Generation Toolkit for Decentraland projects, and help them to generate sustainable event traffic.**\n\n*Check key success metrics & details below","specification":"We will break down our plan in detail here:\n\n**1/ Upgrade our experience and invite more brands and larger traffic.**\n\n**Key success Metrics:**\n- 30%-60% traffic growth during MetaMine Season 2 (month total person times, MAU)\n- 30%-60% traffic growth after MetaMine Seasons 2\n- We will revise the goals during & after MetaMine Season 3 based on MetaMine Season 2 metrics \n\n**Task lists:**\n\n![6](https://i.imgur.com/U20Bx9w.png)\n\n**2/ Package the core technologies that we’ve developed and create a Traffic Generation Toolkit for Decentraland projects, and help them to generate sustainable event traffic.**\n\n- Virtual Currency Creation\n- In-Scene NFT rewards claiming\n- Dynamic Pricing system\n- Discord Bot stocking alert\n- Player data management\n- Onchain reward management\n\nWe would like to help them overpass the technical barriers and generate sustainable event traffic.

That became reality in 2018 and by 2019 the park was filled with various hackathon-winners and mini-games.\n\nWonderMine quickly became one of the most popular Decentraland games, and has become something of a staple. WonderMine is one of the first places new players visit when they enter Decentraland for the first time, a feat we’re very proud of. WonderMine playership increased steadily over time. We currently support about 1,400 players per day (DAU).\n\nSince the WonderMine alpha first launched in June 2020:\n\n* Over **300,000 unique players** have played (mining at least one meteor)\n* Hit a peak DAU of **over 10K players** (December 2021) without performance issues\n* Nearly **20K wearables** (19,865) given to players who crafted them\n* Over **3,600 WonderZone Pickaxe NFTs** given out\n* Over **20 “2X Loot Drop” events** with 300 to 1000 players attending\n* Over **a dozen different collab events** with projects like DG, Vroomway, MetaParty and MetaKey\n\nWonderZone received a Tier 6 grant in January 2022 with a very ambitious roadmap. We planned to hire a new developer but that didn’t pan out, so the full roadmap was more than our small team could accomplish in 6 months. Even so that grant let some of us work full-time, and since we didn’t end up hiring another game dev the funds lasted us almost a full year, instead of 6 months. \n\nHere is what we achieved in 2022:\n\n* Developed a custom NFT smart contract (audited by Solidity Finance: https://solidity.finance/audits/WonderZone) \n* Released the WonderZone Games NFT collection (https://opensea.io/collection/wonderzonegames) \n    * Released 5 NFT pickaxes, with more on the way\n    * Auto-minting when players craft an NFT pickaxe\n    * Innovative contract supports per-item attributes and leveling-up\n* In-game highscores (level + meteors mined)\n* Level-locked crafting\n* Limited item crafting (one per player)\n* Updated UI\n    * Improved meteor loot pop-up\n    * Pickaxe switching functionality\n* Backend event manager (work in progress)\n    * Hub for WZ staff with data dashboards\n    * Easier and quicker to host events in WonderMine\n    * Faster support ticket processing\n* WonderZone Guild House building\n    * A central hub for the WonderZone Amusement park\n    * More buildings in development\n* Many, many, many new WonderZone wearables\n* Seasonal wearables, an organized way of releasing wearable collections\n    * Each season contains 10 new wearables every 2 months\n    * Offered Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs, another step towards self-sufficiency for WonderZone\n* Hired part-time back-end developer/Azure expert\n    * Refactored back-end/server infrastructure for performance and better internal testing\n    * Improved CoinCart process\n\nWe have learned a lot in 2022. We feel more confident in our abilities to deliver on our more realistic goals and milestones. These are features we believe will elevate the current singleplayer mining experience and help us attract new players to the WonderMine game and to Decentraland.\n\nOur goals for WonderMine were to create a game that’s fun to come back to every day and to become a social hub where people hang out in Decentraland, mining and chatting. We feel we’ve been successful with these goals. Our high player retention numbers put us in the top 75% of all games (not just metaverse games). Many of our top players have been playing WonderMine for over two years.","specification":"WonderMine is a social hub, but the gameplay is entirely single-player. Players only see the meteors that fall in their own instance of the scene. With the next roadmap we want to encourage multiplayer gameplay.\n\nThe first step is to enable shared, synchronized meteors, so everyone can see the same drop. This would make all active players rush over to a single location to get the loot first.\n\n## Shared Meteors\n\nWe want to add complexity to the current meteor system, with new categories and tiered meteors that require different levels to mine, including a few meteors that will require collaboration and multiple people to mine at the same time. These meteors will be full of juicy loot! Encouraging players to rush over to these new meteors adds a level of competition to the gameplay, and also requires teamwork to get the loot. \n\nPlayers will still see their own meteors fall at a similar rate. But sometimes a larger, special meteor will drop at the same location for everyone in the scene. The special meteor will require at least 10 players to mine it before it breaks open. Then all 10 players will receive a better-than-normal loot drop for their cooperative mining help.\n\nShared meteors add a new level of player cooperation to the game, which should encourage more interaction and socializing among players. It also adds a competitive element, since you have to be one of the first 10 players to get there.\n\nAfter we deliver the first tier of shared meteors, we have ideas for expanding to other specialty meteor tiers with different in-game mechanics to make WonderMine even more fun.\n\n## The Town Square\n\nWe have begun building a new town square which is going to be a central hub in WonderZone. The square is where new players will spawn and get introduced to WonderZone and all of our games. A place for players to socialize, trade, craft and quest.\n\nWe also want to create a venue with a big screen and stage near WonderMine for hosting events in WonderZone Park. This lets us pursue enhanced collaborations with other Decentraland projects and outside musical artists who can help attract new players. Our strength is in retaining players once they engage with our game. If we can attract new players to an event we can keep many of them playing for a long time to come.\n\n![Town Hub](https://wonderzone.io/img/promo/town1.jpg)\n\n## Seasonal Wearables\n\nWe have reorganized our wearable releases to be seasonal. We create up to 10 wearables and release them at the same time in the crafting machine. Each season contains 1 Mythic, 3-6 Legendaries and 3-6 Epics. The total craftable supply is 3k-6k per season. This means there are always wearables available for players to grind for when mining. \n\nWe want to keep being a hub for new players to socialize and craft their first NFTs for free. Bi-monthly seasonal wearable releases will ensure there are always new wearables for our players.\n \nWe recently introduced Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs for players who want to collect all of the wearables in a season. The Airdrop Passes for Season 1 cost 0.3 ETH each and sold out in about 30 minutes. Airdrop pass holders get all the wearables in a seasonal collection. We only sell 10 passes per season and it's the only way to get the seasonal mythic wearable.\n\nNearly all of our wearables can be crafted for free. Airdrop pass revenues are a small fraction of the cost to create the wearables, but it’s a step in the right direction of becoming a sustainable business.","personnel":"The core team consists of four people with different experience and expertise.

Players are required to input “Raw Material” into these machines to make the final product. Currently, there is a standard “Raw Material” stack that is free of cost and can be used on any of the machines. \nOnce the raw material is equipped, machines take a few seconds to prepare their respective food items. Users can pick up these items and deliver them to NPCs on their tables to complete their orders. Once the order is completed, NPCs leave Cooky coins on their tables which once collected are added to the player's coin counter. Players can reinvest their Cooky coins to buy in-game assets from the Cooky marketplace and improve their earnings.\nThe success of one’s cafe can be measured by the “Popularity Index” which depends on the number of orders the cafe has fulfilled up until now.\n\n## Long-Term Vision \nWe want to build an ecosystem that allows players to create their own custom cafe on the metaverse and invite peers to visit and contribute to the success of their cafe. We will build in-game assets including different food machines, wearables with in-game benefits, customizable table-chair sets, and robots that will help you cater to customers. Players can buy these items using MANA or Cooky coins and equip them in their cafe. We will also launch a bunch of consumable items with temporary in-game benefits.\n\nAlong with the diverse in-game assets, we also want to build a co-op mode where players can share their resources and earnings and run a single cafe. Players will have different roles and the cafe’s profits will be divided based on those roles.\n\nBelow are the gameplay elements of the game:\n### Food Machines \n- Currently, there are 3 food machines: Pizza Oven, Burger Maker and Vending Machine\n- Each machine have a 1:1 ratio of Raw Material input and Food item output. \n- In the future, we will launch many more food machines and allow users to buy them from the in-game marketplace\n- Users will be able to place new machines and change the location of existing machines \n- Machines will also be upgradeable. Upgrades will increase the cost of its food item, holding capacity and it's speed.\n\n### Table-Chair sets\n- Currently, there are 4 tables by default. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 4 NPCs\n- In the future, players will be able to buy more table-chair sets and place them in their cafe, thus improving the capacity of their cafe\n- We will also provide table-chair sets with different designs and capacities (4,6,8 NPCs per table)\n\n### Wearables and Consumables\n- Currently, we have 2 DCL wearables, a Junior Chef, and a Deputy Chef\n- Deputy Chef , when equipped, increases the overall earnings by 10%\n- We'll soon launch Good Luck Cat consumable which increases the inflow of NPCs to the cafe for 5 minutes\n- We will launch more wearables/consumables with benefits such as increased tray capacity, faster movement speed, increased inflow of NPC, etc\n\n### Robot Helpers\n- Robot/NPC helpers will be added in the upcoming updates. \n- They will help in serving prepared food items to the NPCs and in equipping raw materials for the food machines\n\nPlease note that all the above in-game assets will be minted as ERC-721 NFTs on the Polygon chain","specification":"To take Cooky to the next level and create the features mentioned above we will need to work on it full-time with a team of developers and designers.

Featured multiple top artists including Mr Misang (Korea), who was recognized as one of the top 3 highest selling artists on SuperRare last year, and Lickpalik (Indonesia), a pop cultural icon whose comics are read by most Indonesians\n\n* Mar 2022: Asia Sings with Ukraine charity music concert, raised ~10 ETH (about $30,000) from numerous NFT collections all over Asia (Pre-DCL)\n\n* May 2022: Collaboration with Japan Philharmonic Orchestra (est. 1956), Japan's first symphony orchestra, to screen their ticketed performance LIVE (Pre-DCL)\n\n* May 2022: 14 unique pop-up experiences based on various popular NFT collections globally and in Asia (CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, CloneX, Azuki, MoonBirds, World of Woman, Doodles, Karafuru, Supernormal, 8sian, Phantabear, Neo Tokyo, CyberKongz, Cool Cats)\n\n* Aug 2022: Decentraland Art Week, featuring architecture and NFT collections from Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines\n\n* Oct 2022: DigitX in Decentraland, partnered with De La Salle University, one of the top 3 universities in the Philippines; over 300 students participated in the online lecture sessions\n\n* Dec 2022: Poetry showcase featuring student work from Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages – the top language university in Taiwan\n\nUpcoming:\n* Film metaverse build in partnership with Ever Rolling Films from Vietnam, based on their short film Roommate that premiered in Cannes Festival in 2018\n* Asia Ape Hub to feature Bored Ape Yacht Club holders from Asia building in Web3, to offer more exposure for Decentraland across other web3 niches","specification":"The grant will cover three main aspects: \n* Metaverse Development Architects: Design & Building ($5,000+ / month)\n* Partnership Specialists: Business Development & Partnerships ($2,000+ / month)\n* Marketing & Hybrid Events Specialists (In real life + metaverse) ($500+ / month)\n* Buffer costs ($500+ / month)\n* TOTAL: $8,000+ / month\n\nAs the bulk of the work will be metaverse development, for the purpose of estimating salary estimates, we can assume the following team composition:\n4x Metaverse Development Architects (2 Japan, 2 Philippines), 2x Partnership Specialists, 1x Marketing (Online & Events) Specialist\n\n1. Metaverse Development Architect:\nAccording to CryptoJobsList, the average Metaverse Architect makes an average of $55K / year, or $4.6K / month. \n\nAssuming this is based on the US and if we adjust for Purchasing Price Parity or PPP (differences in cost of living), this will be $3.4K / month in Japan and $1.6K / month in the Philippines.

We assume $500 / month for travel and $1500 / month for salary each, for a total of $4K per month for two people.\n\nAgain, to be conservative we halve this amount to $2K / month.\n\nAs the goal is to build for a variety of entities in the film and education sector, the partnership specialist role is essential.\n\n3. Marketing & Hybrid Events Specialist (In real life + metaverse):\nTo enhance the experiences and results, on occasion we may need funds for marketing and hybrid events to maximize activation rates, or depending on the needs of the entities we are partnering with. We budget $500 / month for this expense.\n\n4. Buffer:\nWe budget $500 / month as a buffer.\n\nTotal budget estimated to be $8K / month.\n\nBased on the above budget, this will give us a development runway of 7.5 months (based on conservative estimates) or less.\n\nOver a period of 10 months, AsiaVerse aims to achieve the goals of having at least 1 large-scale film event and 1 large-scale university event, involving a total of 8 to 12 major entities from all over Asia (as above). \n\nIn reality, as the grant will only cover part of the total calculated expenses, the team will most likely take in less than that. The team will continue to build, driven by our passion to build our metaverse portfolio for the long-term and to connect Asia with the world, as we have done in 2022.\n\nWith what AsiaVerse has achieved so far with only volunteers and personal financial contributions, we are certain that we can achieve a lot more with the grant to support our efforts to expand metaverse participation and development throughout Asia, bridging East and West to drive substantial cultural and business value in a truly decentralized metaverse.

High-quality documentation (like Mozilla's MDN) goes beyond technical specification and actually helps in writing solid code that works reliably and avoids common pitfalls. It’s alive, up-to-date with recent developments, aligned with current practice and responsive to feedback from readers.\n\nThis documentation must:\n- Provide a high-level overview of the protocol and all its components\n- Maintain an up-to-date specification of the most important APIs and components\n- Guide implementers towards good architectural decisions and away from pitfalls\n- Address common misunderstandings that tend to arise during development\n- Help readers navigate transitions from deprecated methods to newer variants\n- Welcome feedback from readers so they can point out problems and offer suggestions\n\n### Implementing Alternative Explorers\n\nThe World Explorer is the principal client of the Decentraland protocol, by virtue of using the entire set of features and introducing requirements that drive the development of the underlying software.\n\nWe’ll build three new implementations that rely on different frameworks and utilities, and can tackle these problems from a fresh start taking new approaches while armed with the accumulated lessons and discoveries of the Foundation.\n\n[Click here to read about the rationale and criteria used for each implementation](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Criterions-for-Engine-Selection-e55f8ea382f94ff0943bce383b7c7816), a [comparison of engines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15NOnGhBiVaZk4gTeW-Gmd7cWUdmf1_6PeUUPVTM5WtY/edit#gid=0) and how well do they fit with each criteria, and [join the discussion about the Protocol Squad](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-a-protocol-squad-for-the-dao/17000) on the forum.\n\nThe protocol documentation will be tested and refined as these efforts progress.\n\nThe three implementations have different goals:\n\n1. **Short-term, production-ready** (Unity): aiming to become the most popular among players, this implementation would prioritize enhanced performance, distribution on game and app stores, broad reach for developers, and attention to legal licensing in today's market.\n\n2. **Educational** (BabylonJS): new developers joining the Decentraland community can greatly benefit from an implementation that prioritizes readability and organization, easy addition of new features, widely known programming languages and simple tooling.

We offer our training programs for free to people from emerging countries (currently from Africa and Southeast Asia), who otherwise cannot afford blockchain education. We connect them to employers with whom they would otherwise not have any touchpoints. This is how we foster educational and financial inclusion. \n\nWe have educated more than 650 people in the past 6 months and 30% of them were hired directly after our training. More than 2000 people have subscribed for training and recruitment with us. Currently in our talent pool we have: \n* 250+ Solidity Developers \n* 700+ Content Creators\n* 550+ Community Managers\n\n### Strong Partnerships in the Web3 Space\nEkoLance currently has 8 sourcing partners with a total community of over 20.000 people from which we regularly get talented professionals to subscribe to our training programs. We partner with universities, Blockchain, and Tech Hubs, which promote our training programs and services to their members. \n\n### We cooperate with corporates, who train and recruit from our talent pool\n\nWe invite blockchain professionals to train our talents, so they have the most up-to-date and practical training experience possible. Companies, which have participated in our training programmes are: Ankr, Blockdaemon, Blocksize Capital, Pillar Foundation, HER DAO, Metagamehub DAO, ReCheck, AuditOne, Quantstamp, Basenode.io, YieldGuildGames, Luna Vision, BeInCrypto.\n\nCompanies, which have recruited from our talent pool are: Quantstamp, Micobo, ReCheck, O2k.tech, Getonboard.gg.\n\n### Benefits for Decentraland\nWith Ekolance in Decentraland, we will have the first training and recruitment center in the Metaverse, bringing together companies and talents from all sectors to the Metaverse. This center will offer innovative opportunities for talents to get trained to work for Web3 companies and become part of the communities as well as for companies to recruit the right talent for them. This will provide proper and retentive user engagement via true utilities which are constantly pushed via weekly initiatives such as educational trainings, events, quests, job matching, socializing and more taking place on top of the LANDs. Decentraland community members also benefit from direct access to talents, who are familiar with Decentraland and are trained to work in the Metaverse apart from the user and adoption growth this provides. Since most of the trainees will have zero to little experience with web3 before this, it will serve as a major boost for adoption and to onboard the masses to Decentraland and thus foster mainstream adoption. \n\nFurthermore, it will allow Decentraland to position itself as the entry point and “home” for everyone’s Metaverse journey and strongly place itself at the center of metaverse adoption via a strong focus on education - something that is often neglected in the web3 space.","specification":"Our first installment is going to be a minimal experience on 2 LANDs, that already covers the basic structure for a good learning experience and job placement:\n* an info reception / welcome area\n* a learning board and video screens with learning material covering several topics\n* guided learning - incentivized by a proper engagement model, NFT certificates, and other rewards\n* live training sessions\n* partner placement\n* job board\n* search dashboard for employers\n\nThe experience will consist of a building with several different areas serving the above purposes on different floors.\n\nWe will implement a learning board that is connected to a server backend serving dynamic course content. This includes creating a web interface for managing the learning contents. The learning board is meant to be used for self-studying. Its contents will grow over time - initially, it will cover basics around Community Management, Web3 Content Creation and Solidity Development. Further learning content can be streamed as video on screens inside the Ekolance building.\nThe solution we are implementing could also be used by other educational content creators in Decentraland.\n\nFor guided learning, we will be implementing an engagement model that incentivizes and supports the learning progress of the students with a specialized UI showing course progress, learning milestones, course certificates (users gain POAP certificates as proof for attending a course), and further information.\n\nLive training sessions will be held over a video stream in regular intervals. Contents of the live training sessions will be added to the learning board contents.\n\nFinally, there will be an area for partner placement including a job board, with additional screens that partners can use for presenting.\n\nEmployers will be able to browse and search through available talents and check their on-chain certification, and be able to directly contact them.\n\nThis grant is meant to cover the costs of developing a basic technical infrastructure for the above learning experience. It will be the foundation for further development.\n\nIn future steps, we plan to drive knowledge transfer between students by a more sophisticated engagement model and will improve the overall learning experience by refining course material and the underlying UI. Organizing information in a 3D space yields many possibilities that need to be explored for optimal education.\n\n### Ekolance Grant Event\nWe are hosting an event in Decentraland this Thursday, December 15, 4pm CET with one of our partners (MetaGameHub DAO).

The VR client was ported to run natively on the Meta Quest, a significant technical milestone that made Decentraland’s codebase Android compatible. \n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/wcO6pccF7qaJvEgRhl/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nThe team brought the PCVR and Quest VR clients to parity with the web/desktop versions of Decentraland by bringing all screen UI and pop-ups into VR and made in-game interactions work with the VR controllers. \n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Zve6MHsVpafIDDine1/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nThe VR client team also made stability improvements, implemented a new VR user interface, and made heavy strides towards squashing bugs and incompatibilities related to the Android headset conversion. For the final deliverable of the previous grant, the team published Decentraland VR to the SideQuest store, which can be downloaded at: (https://sidequestvr.com/app/11626)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GdxH4ggl.png)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/hSZwZkQeStWXoPv1gB/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nIn this grant proposal, the VR client team seeks to continue maintaining, enhancing features, and improving the performance of the Decentraland VR clients over the next 6 months. \n\n## Summary of proposed work\nA summary of proposed activities is provided in this section, with additional details in the specification section of this proposal.\n\n- **New Minimum Viable Experience approach:** Shout out to Yemel for this item! Our team agrees with [community feedback]( https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/7?u=mr0ng) from our previous grant proposal that rearchitecting the current Decentraland VR client may be in the best interest for the long term success and efficiency of the project. Our proposed approach is outlined in the specifications section.\n![]( https://i.imgur.com/wdki9fal.png)\n- **Feature enhancements:** The team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR and VRM avatar support, and enhancements on the VR user interface. VRM support is also in response to this [DAO proposal that passed]( https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bdafe1c0-1d6b-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b) by Morph.\n![](https://vrm.dev/en/_images/alicia_scene2.png)\n- **Maintenance and Stability:** The team will continue to maintain the VR client over the next 6 months, fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. The team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs.\n- **Marketing, PR and Social Media, store submissions:** Shout out to Gino for this item! Per [community feedback received on our previous grant proposal]( https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/6?u=mr0ng), we’re dedicating a portion of the grant budget towards Marketing and PR for raising awareness of Decentraland VR. We will also push the client to more stores in order to bring Decentraland to a wider audience.","specification":"## New Minimum Viable Experience Refactor\nThe team agrees with the [approach proposed by Yemel]( https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/7?u=mr0ng) that we need to start building a dedicated Decentraland VR client from the ground up. This is in contrast to the current approach, which is a VR port of the existing Decentraland client. In order to maintain continuity and keep a version of Decentraland VR available to the community, we propose to work on this MVE refactor in parallel to maintaining and enhancing the current VR client. This is because any work done towards the current VR client such as hand tracking or VRM support (and more) can also be used on the new MVE.\n\n## VR Feature Enhancements \nThe team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, [VRM Avatar support]( https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bdafe1c0-1d6b-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b), and enhancements on the VR user interface. The VR client will still maintain controller support. The hand-tracking update will not replace controller support, but will be an alternative way to interact within Decentraland VR. We will also look at enhancing the avatar movements to leverage expanded movement in VR. For example, waving hands, limb movements (crouching), and more avatar movements that follows the user’s physical movement. We will expand upon the VR UI implement during the previous grant to make it easier to access quick actions like emotes, mic settings, and teleportation to parcels.\n\n## Maintenance and Stability\nThe team will continue to maintain the Decentraland client for the duration of this grant period (6 months), fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs. \n\nThe largest component of this category will be to convert Decentraland existing asset bundle system (currently only set up for the web client / WebGL) and make it android-compatible for the standalone VR clients. This will result in a major improvement in frame rate, memory usage, and overall stability of the VR client because the asset bundles are more optimized than loading in the GLTF models directly.\n\nWe also propose to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the VR client and implement a synchronized release schedule with the primary Decentraland client. \nWe will seek to automate this process as much as possible to reduce future manual maintenance needs.\n\n## Marketing, PR and Social Media, store submissions\nPer [community feedback received on our previous grant proposal]( https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/6?u=mr0ng), we’re dedicating a portion of the grant budget towards Marketing and PR for raising awareness of Decentraland VR. This will involve regular social media posting, video and tutorial publications, blog posts, interviews, press releases and other dissemination methods. We will also push the VR client to more stores to reach a wider audience. This includes being published first to Meta’s AppLabs store, and then to its full store which will make Decentraland VR available to an estimated 15-20 million players and vastly lower the technical hurdles to get it installed. We will also look to publish Decentraland VR to the SteamVR store.\n\n## High level budget breakdown\n![Budget](https://i.imgur.com/b21JBUI.png)","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/","roadmap":"The team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

To emphasize this idea we’ve decided to run the event on two platforms simultaneously, in Decentraland a massive neighborhood would be developed specially for this event and from there you could teleport to a new world in \nArhead to explore even more amazing spaces.\n \n- huge exhibition space in two metaverse platforms: Decentraland and Arhead\n\n- architectural competition open to creators with any experience\n\n- more than 20 pavilions by the creators from all over the world\n\n- expositions by well-known architects and designers\n\n- lectures and public talks \n\n- thousands of amazing people to meet during the event\n\nThe event will consist of several pavilions designed by well-known architectural studios such as Zaha Hadid, SpacesDAO, Atrium, Shop, Crosby Studios (TBC) and others as well as emerging designers selected by a contest. In addition to this there will be lectures, discussions, NFT-exhibitions, art-installations and more, so anyone with interest in architecture and design could enjoy the event.\n\nMANIFESTO\n\n\nWe believe that as graphic designers have created the internet we’ve been using for the last decades, the Metaverse would be created by architects and designers.\n\nThe tittle of Biennale \"Presence of the future\" refers to the name of the first Venice Architecture Biennale - one of the greatest events to celebrate architecture and design. \"Presence of the past'' was actually the name of the 1980 Biennale directed by Paolo Portoghesi who has managed to organize an event of global significance bringing together great architects from around the world.\n\nNowadays, more than forty years later our perception of the world and design approach have changed dramatically, digital design tools became the main instruments and created a totally new language and, some might say, in our society and culture Postmodernism has been replaced by Metamodernism (whatever that means after the word Meta has become a brand).\n\nAll in all, \"Presence of the future\" aims to recall the power of architecture to reinvent the modernity and formulate the new quality of life in the immersive virtual space. In the moment when we are witnessing the creation of a new game-changer in the way we communicate, entertain and collaborate we challenge the architects and designers to envision our future in the built form and take the responsibility for it. We believe that this exhibition would bring the life-changing power of architecture and design to the metaverse and would set up a new positive vector for its development.","specification":"OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS \t\n\n1st stage: open call for submissions\nCandidats will send 3 visualisations of 3d-modeled architectural object reflecting the theme of the Biennale “Presence of the Future” and 200-500 words description of the concept.

We plan to release a brand new Fuego Circuits track every month, and brand new vehicles and attributes often.\n\n### Milestones Achieved:\n\n- Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties, and build commissions. We have given 5% of those revenues back to the DAO total of $152.40 USDC over 3 months.\n- NFT floor prices rising as high as 750% on some vehicles.\n- Players have already earned 224 mana from crafting 7 of the 12 new skins/vehicles. The highest floor is currently 60 mana.\n- Twitter account nearing 600 followers.\n- Fully integrated 21 NFT-based vehicles with full functionality.\n- Two additional non-vehicle NFT-based wearables with full functionality.\n- Established a new sponsor: The Holy Ones to our 3 existing sponsors.\n- Created 3 Game Modes: Solo-Sprint, Demo Derby, and Fuego Circuits.\n- Created 5 different game tracks.\n- Integrated 9 different collectible resources and a robust crafting system.\n- Built an interactive club with Dance and Earn utility with live events and unique musical entertainment.\n- Held 3 different parties to celebrate the launch of each stage of the game with a DJ performance, and community giveaways - One for Alpha, Beta, and the launch.\n- Including performances by our own Nikki Fuego in Drag, bringing more Drag culture to Decentraland.\n- Organized 9 giveaways, of Beta wings, vehicles, and in-game rewards.\n- We started a 10-week tournament where we pick 1 winner with the fastest Solo-Sprint time and awarded 10 MANA. In our first 4 weeks, we have had 175 participants!\n- Started our weekly events with LIVE entertainment and giveaways.

We have an extremely unique setup with our instancing and require some outside skillsets to elevate parts of our infrastructure. Our integration with the Infinity Engine was a huge accomplishment and enhanced Vroomway’s original vision tenfold. We learned a lot with that integration and it has sparked even more innovation on how to develop this going forward. We would like to both upgrade and enhance the current game modes, but also release some community-suggested game modes that we believe will put Vroomway above par with previous racing games in the web3 industry. This new budget also allows the majority of our team to give more full-time attention to the project. \n\nWe have generated revenue consistently over 4 months and have generated revenue this month (November) as well.\n\nOur game generated over 2,500 MANA sales in wearables (primary and secondary combined). In addition, our players purchased 452 MANA worth of FUEL in-game. \n\nIt’s worth noting that since the beginning of our first grant we vowed to pay 5% of our revenue generated each month back to the DAO until the grant is paid back. We are keeping that vow with this grant as well. We have already shown good faith in this with 4 consecutive months of giving 5% back totaling $155~. Although a small amount, it shows that we can create revenue and eventually pay back the grants in full.\n\n## Budget Breakdown & Road Map:\n\nMarketing: $19,800 - 6 months\n\nPersonnel: $54,000 - 6 months\n\nDevelopment: $43,000 - 6 months\n\nUnexpected/Cushion: $3,200 - 6 months\n\nTotal: $120,000\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xqg7Qa2.png)\n\nWe have revised the previous budget to exclude 50% of the personnel cost, $30k in development cost, and 50% of the previous marketing budget.","personnel":"Nikki Fuego - Founder, Project Manager, Lead 3D Artist: \nhttps://twitter.com/NikkiFuego92\n\nNeocyber - Lead Developer: \nhttps://twitter.com/neocyber_eth\n\nDOCTORdripp - Community Manager: \nhttps://twitter.com/DOCTORdrippNFT\n\nckbubbles - Marketing, PR, Event Coordinator: \nhttps://twitter.com/iamckbubbles\n\nDoki - 3D Wearables:\nhttps://twitter.com/Doki3D","roadmap":"We believe we can achieve the goals mentioned above with 3 phases:\n\nJanuary 2023 & February 2023\nPhase 1 - Refactor & Upgrade:\n\nWe plan to refactor some of our earliest infrastructure for better scene performance. We will also refactor our Demo Derby Game Mode as this has been the most difficult hurdle we have faced. We want to redesign the game mode with better technology. We will upgrade our other game modes and the gathering profession to provide variety in difficulty and experiences. We will also add in-game coin sinks with these upgrades.\n\nMarch 2023 & April 2023\nPhase  - New Game Modes and Player Ownership Value:\n\nPlayers have heavily requested two new game modes that are Drag Racing and a new version of our Grand Prix that was held in April of 2022. Drag Racing would be a linear sprint utilizing the infinity engine. It would be a point a to point b sprint with gear-shifting mechanics integrated. \nThe Grand Prix game mode would be an event every 6 months that supports up to 20 racers racing in an Indie 500-style race. \n\nMay 2023 & June 2023\nPhase 3 - Player Economy and Ownership Value:\n\nWe believe that the players are the most important part of our game aside from the fun factor. With this in mind, we want to always provide value both in the economy and the time spent in-game. We would like to introduce new ways to earn via mini-games that add more value to the main game modes.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":16970,"scores_total":9682971.005358713,"votes":156,"manaVP":4709715.666278192,"landVP":720000,"namesVP":226000,"delegatedVP":3959338.3390805204,"vesting_address":"0xF265A437cC3566492221266B69ef69dd8936aa4c","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 5","size":120000,"beneficiary":"0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5","token":"DAI","vesting_released":39325,"vesting_releasable":4947.955246913581,"vesting_start_at":"2022-12-20T00:30:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-06-18T00:30:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":80675,"vesting_total_amount":120000,"vesting_status":"In Progress","done_updates":2,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"pending","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-02-17T08:08:09.803Z","next_update":"2023-03-20T00:30:00.117Z","pending_updates":4},{"id":"4772fdb0-74e3-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556","snapshot_id":"0x9fb99be5b3bc14d42801984cd9209d2488dd33ce61013c729cb5f70fd8d89567","user":"0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d","type":"grant","title":"Governance Squad 1H2023 Renewal","start_at":"2022-12-05T21:25:00.347Z","finish_at":"2022-12-19T21:25:00.347Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Governance Squad 1H2023 Renewal","abstract":"Renew and expand the previously passed Grant to fund the team responsible for maintaining and improving the DAO Governance dApp.\n\nPrevious Grants proposals [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) (1H 2022) and [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=524fb800-d532-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) (2H 2022)","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":179360,"beneficiary":"0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698","email":"gino@decentraland.org","description":"The DAO Governance Squad has been created in January 2022 as a result of a Community Grant given by the Decentraland DAO.

This concept is one of a new, alternative reality complete with almost all the amenities of real life.\nTo be able to truly compete with real life experiences, the metaverse has to step up its offerings and start including features that transcend the virtual/real barrier and provide its users with value they can benefit from in their day-to-day life. This is the premise of our platform.\nMetaTrekkers, using its reputation and connections, is set to bring the most ambitious and comprehensive educational proposal, which will actively work towards increasing the number of highly-engaged users in Decentraland, interested in learning and development.","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3","email":"hello@metatrekkers.io","description":"The belief that positive development and evolution of the metaverse can only be achieved through educating the users, has been at the core of our value proposition from the very beginning.\n\nIn preparation for development of this education platform, MetaTrekkers has already begun securing collaborations with various keynote speakers and personalities who are considered leading professionals in their fields.\n\nOur aim is to onboard their massive follower audience and those interested in the topics promoted by these guests, and introduce them to the perks of education through the metaverse:\nGlobal accessibility\nFirst-hand, personal experiences\nUnlimited networking opportunities\nLike-minded community\n\nAs part of this platform, MetaTrekkers will develop a dedicated center in Decentraland, with a total surface of 9 parcels, which will provide multiple settings and environments designed to cater to the specific educational requirements of any topic presented by our guest speakers.\n\nWe strongly believe that the long-term success of the metaverse depends on proving it’s a stable environment that provides its users with valuable tools and means to expand their knowledge, and a long list of opportunities for self and professional development.\n\nWhat makes our proposal unique in the web3 educational space is an innovative concept which we like to call the Institute for Decentralized Education Opportunities (IDEO) – a fully decentralized organization where the users can take on an active role in the educational process by voting on topics, speakers and activities, and engaging in interactive learning experiences.\n\nBeing a long-term project, the education platform will also include a program that rewards attendance, activity and involvement with education-related NFT giveaways, job opportunities and exclusive experiences. This rewards program will employ the support and collaboration of many other venues, projects and organizations, from both Decentraland and outside the metaverse. In addition, MetaTrekkers is currently in the process of securing partnerships with organizations like the Texas Blockchain Council, which would translate into access to real-world summits, seminars and sessions where platform users would benefit from exclusive networking opportunities and access.\n\nEstablishing Decentraland as an environment that not only supports its community’s development but provides the actual educational resources to achieve such growth, is a technique that can reach a large audience and help onboard and transform them into highly active Decentraland users.\n\nGiven the nature of this initiative, MetaTrekkers is currently seeking to obtain TEDx certification as an official partner for the metaverse, thus adding considerable value and credibility to this space, and paving the road for the launch of the educational platform.\n\nWith the funds from the grant, MetaTrekkers will develop and market the platform, and will compensate the speakers.","specification":"In order to put the plan in motion, MetaTrekkers has already started taking action towards the development of the education platform.\n\nFirst of all, while we’re waiting for an official response on our TEDx application, MetaTrekkers has begun the process of applying to other academic talks platforms in the effort to guarantee an exclusive educational experience to Decentraland users.\n\nTo ensure a successful result for this initiative, MetaTrekkers will develop its own program, within the IDEO platform, which will feature metaverse streaming services for a host of seminars, courses, and other academic sessions.\n\nIn addition to the value we’re bringing to the existing Decentraland community, we’ll also be taking care of injecting new visitors and users into the Decentraland world. This will happen by constantly engaging with new audiences through our favorite tool – The MetaTrekkers Onboarding Program, composed of four steps:\n\n- Onboarding speakers\n\n- Onboarding speakers’ fanbase\n\n- Exclusive Decentraland tours for speakers and fan base\n\n- Speakers will lead an extra talk/session on the confirmed onboarding date\n\nThe first step towards developing this education platform is hosting the “Dia de los Muertos” event at the MetaTrekkers Club venue, where Decentraland users and visitors will be able to discover and learn about the customs and traditions of one of Mexico’s most important holidays of the year. The event, led by none other than VJ Deliria, is set to educate guests through NFT art, music and direct engagement, about the rich culture surrounding this day of celebration.\n\nAnother successful step we’ve taken is to secure a strategic partnership with DCENTRAL CON, through which we’ve gained exclusive rights to stream the November 28-30 Miami event at the MetaTrekkers Club in Decentraland. This will already translate into an influx of new visitors and users, composed of an audience unable to attend the event in person. If we take a look at last year’s numbers, the NFT convention reached an in-person attendance of more than 5,000 individuals, with many more seeking a means to participate virtually. Just to get an idea of the importance of this conference, here are a few speakers who will be engaging the audience: Baron Davis (NBA), Michael Blank (Polygon), Anastasia Drinevskaya (Cointelegraph).\n\nOne of MetaTrekkers community’s advantages is that its founder, Chris Oniya, is also Texas Blockchain Council’s (TBC) ambassador for Houston. For the Decentraland community, this means that Lee Bratcher, Founder and President of TBC, will be one of the first speakers to engage with the IDEO users.\n\nAnother key speaker that will headline one of the main events of the educational platform will be Lennox Matsinde, co-founder of Satoshi’s Index and Product Manager at Starbucks Corporate – one of the latest additions on the list of big brands actively exploring the opportunities of metaverse representation.\n\nYu-Kai Chou, a crowd favorite, is the creator of the Octalysis framework, a keynote speaker on our education platform, and regarded as #1 Gamification Gurus. His work in the field of gamification is linked to substantial improvements in the experience of over 1 billion users.","personnel":"Directory: https://bit.ly/3Um9mFx\n\nThe team of professionals responsible for the development, launching and marketing of the educational platform:\n\nChris Oniya, MetaTrekkers Founder\n\nJim Flint, Local Search Group Digital Marketing, Founder and President\n\nJulia, Web3 Educational Advisor\n\nChris West, Digital Marketing Specialist\n\nSwivel Meta, Metaverse Development\n\nMelanie Girald, Strategic Planning Consultant\n\nJulio Balbueno, Strategic Planning Consultant\n\nSynthia Nominae, Metaverse Onboard Lead\n\nJay Vee - Project Manager\n\nJulie Anne - Administrative Assistant       \n\nPsyche - Social Media Coordinator\n\nNeo - Video Editor Assistant","roadmap":"The initial stage of the project implies the development, marketing and launching of the platform, including hosting a minimum 15 educational events featuring at least 15 keynote speakers.\n\nStarting at the beginning of the year 2023 we’ll deploy the development tasks to our team of professionals, while the month of February will kick off the first series of seminars, sessions and talks.\n\n2022\n- Exclusive streaming of the TBC Summit \n\n- Women of Web3 Summit\n\n- DCentral Con Miami\n\n- Maxing Out Your Meta-Con Experience Conference \n\nJanuary 2023\n\n- Development of the educational platform begins\n\n- Pre-launch, marketing campaign\n\nFebruary\n\n- Development of the platform ends\n\n- First educational sessions hosted in Decentraland, complete with 4-step onboarding program\n\n- Bloomberg/Forbes news article about the launch of the platform.

This is not a new thing, but the ability to meet social, work, educational, cultural, and even IRL maintenance without ever leaving your computer exploded in post-covid. With this explosion of work from home coupled with tradition gym closures and technologically leverage products like Peloton reaching mass adoption, the future partnership of exercise and the metaverse finally moved beyond its perpetually nascent phase. \n\nTo say it has reached full adoption, or is technically proficient as desired, would be taking great liberty with the truth. However, while the technology is lagging, the social structure of sports, includes its competitive nature, are taking subtle but significant steps. Beyond a traditional leader board displaying a name and temporary high score, individualized avatar athletes provide recognition, branding, and the under pinning of the tribal mentality associated with sports rivalries.\n\nDigital uniforms and team names and identities which under tradition are regionally formed, with specialized equipment and sponsorship following, has been turned on its head. In contrast, factors including time zones, preferred equipment, technological compatibility and political affiliations are component parts of the whole. While not the focus of this project, these factors must be considered during any ethical design review process. As these factors could lead to over exertion and injury in any environment, we will endeavor to identify and isolate their direct impact on the metaverse based virtual gaming environment. \n\nAs discussed above, home exercise has moved leaps and bounds from aerobic types of yesteryear. Now, instead of being led by the recording, we are now recording the leader. However, that leader is not always human and classes give way for competition on a more regular basis. Without the unpredictability of inclement weather, cost of ravel, ongoing communication, and generally large time commitment associated with organized sporting events, more frequent and bespoke functions are possible. \n\nRanging from a group of friends virtually cycling together to an esports arena teaming with thousands, virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically. Biomedical research and implementation while quite conspicuous with the Invictus games, the impact of tech many not be as obvious in character design and movement. For example, at one of the most simple designs, an underwater adventure game, while perfectly safe for the human behind the goggles, would spell destruction if replicated in the real world. While seemingly far-fetched and low-hanging fruit as an example, it speaks to a potentially increasing problem, realism in avatar function and design. Even the greatest suspension of reality would have difficulty reasonably finding a gamer trying to fly off a building as a dragon. But could the same be said for a human gamer trying to imitate a Tetris style climbing game in the real world if digitally designed? In light of the multiple injuries suffered each year in pursuit of social media challenges like the mild crate climb, these risks become increasingly foreseeable. Simply put, as the likeness to human increases in avatar, does the risk of injury though imitation on competition simply increase?","specification":"# Research question\n\nTo what degree, if any, does an omnidirectional sporting device and combination with virtual reality increase the risk of injury to the participant? \n\n## Sub Questions\n\n1.

The team at MOD have been working for 12 months with experts in the field to create an intuitive application that allows users to easily make 3D wearables and accessories in the simplest way. Our achievements to date include building MOD Studio, a Unity, web browser based application that enables users to select from an extensive library or upload their own wearables and easily edit textures and materials to create high quality custom assets to wear or sell in the metaverse. Users are also able to adjust the lighting, skybox image and take pictures within the studio. With MOD Studio it is quick, easy and cheap for artists and communities to bring their vision to life, while staying in full control of the creative process. The software can be trialled here: https://app.getmod.studio/ \n\nWe believe our application will be invaluable to the continued success of Decentraland. It will make 3D modeling and design more accessible to the Decentraland community, including the large user base without access to technical knowledge, expensive hardware and advanced software. For example, the cost to hire a designer to make a simple item like a T-shirt, hoodie or pants starts between $50-150, with an additional fee to publish to Decentraland. This makes wearables financially inaccessible to many users. Currently, there are no transaction fees in MOD Studio. In 2023 we will be implementing small transaction fees to publish wearables created in the software. This feel will be minimal in order to keep the application accessible to everyone and attract a wide user base.","specification":"The key updates that will benefit Decentraland users include: \n\n**1.

Funding from the DAO will enable MetaParty to develop a multifunctional space within Decentraland, where the team can increase the quality of MetaParty events. The team will conduct the following: \n\n1.\tMetaParty HQ:\nWithin the MetaParty HQ we intend to host 12 events per month including, dance parties, interactive mini game challenges and sponsored events. The build will have multiple levels and a user interface allowing players to easily teleport around the parcel and take part in multiple challenges. We intend to hire established artists from within the Decentraland community and onboard artists into Decentraland to perform at events. We intend to improve upon the MetaParty HQ over time.\n\n2.\tCyberStrife: RPG style Play-To-Earn game:\nOver the past four months, our team has been working hard to develop CyberStrife, a RPG-style Play-to-Earn game. We have released multiple versions of the game into Decentraland to gain feedback from the community. MetaParty has partnered with MetaZone to improve the experience of CyberStrife, by implementing a save game feature, NFT delegation feature and distributed version of the game. By having an array of diverse experiences in Decentraland, the team believes we will retain active users and build upon our community. By using a smart contract we will repay the DAO 10% royalties of all sales of the CyberStrife game. Furthermore, 10% of all CyberStrife and MetaParty merchandise will be sent to the DAO until the grant is fully repaid.\n\n3.\tMonthly Community Fashion Shows:\nThe MetaParty team aims to highlight and showcase different artists within this space through our unique “Community Fashion Show” event. Earlier this year, MetaParty worked directly with the Decentraland Foundation to host MetaVerse Fashion Week 2022 (MVFW), in which numerous artists showcase their wearables to the community. Due to the success of MVFW the MetaParty team reintroduced Community Fashion Shows, originally we asked creators within the space to sponsor the event in an effort to raise a prize pool for the audience. We realized that this model limits certain creators from participating. Moving forward Community Fashions Shows will be free of charge, and aim to capture the phenomenal work of wearable artists within this community.\n\n4.\tRegular Live stream and Podcasts:\nAs active YouTube and Twitch streamers, the MetaParty team (Rezinator and FriskyBumbleBee) has been creating live content surrounding topics and organizations within the Decentraland space, showcasing many individuals and organizations within this space and their hard work in getting to where they are today. The team believes that by providing engaging content and enabling collaboration between different organizations, we can potentially onboard and attract quality users into Decentraland.\n\n5.\tCross Metaverse Hub:\nThe team will engage in community outreach to new metaverses (spatial IO in particular) and create a cross-platform hub in the MetaParty HQ. By collaborating with community leaders within Spatial IO, the team believes it will increase the organic growth of new users in Decentraland. The goal is to not only create a hub located in the MetaParty HQ but to also collaborate with Spatial IO, creating a unique build within their platform; this will create a bridge between both metaverses, allowing multiple events to happen in both Decentraland and Spatial IO.","specification":"The MetaParty team will be working directly with MetaZone, achieving the following: implementing the save game feature, NFT delegation, listing the CyberStrife game for sale as a distributed version on the MetaZone website, redesigning the UI, ensuring data integrity and improving the game experience over time. The team will also create and release new NFTs, smart wearables, and create unique player experiences through the RPG system. We aim to collaborate with other Decentraland creators to bring more interoperability to DCL and diverse experiences which the team believes will assist in scalability and retention for the platform.\n\nThe CyberStrife RPG will be available to purchase on the MetaZone website as a Meta NFT. Owners of these NFTs can deploy the CyberStrife game to their land. Game data carries over between parcels and this offers landowners an opportunity to bring more foot traffic to their parcels. As previously mentioned, 10% of all CyberStrife game sales will be sent back to the DAO via smart contract until the grant is fully repaid.\n\nBy introducing the distributed CyberStrife game we aim to expand our team over time and embark on a road of becoming self-sustainable. The team aims to provide the utmost immersive experience for all citizens in Decentraland. The team will continue to create and host unique experiences with an aim to improve upon each event.\n\nIn addition, Community Fashion Shows are popular events within the Decentraland community and have been since MetaVerse Fashion Show 2022. The team will incorporate this as a continuous event that will be hosted once a month. A new build will be created by the team for each event and all community wearable / emote creators will be invited to walk the runway and showcase their designs for no charge. A prize pool will be allocated for each event, giving players an incentive to create and post Decentraland videos to Twitter and YouTube to win prizes. Furthermore, the entire audience will be invited to walk the runway at the end of the events and showcase their favorite outfits in the “Best Dressed Challenge”.\n\nYou can watch over 110 videos focused completely on Decentraland and MetaParty via The Rezinator's YouTube channel, furthermore FriskyBumbleBee has hosted over 25 streams centered around Decentraland on twitch, re-uploading those videos to YouTube.\n\nThe Rezinator:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73LJQ2EVw0whsh9gEKlMZQ\n\nFriskyBumbleBee:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjejVwNdLt36N1vel66M0w/videos\n\nBudget Breakdown: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QpxdThw-p91ZzBKc5f69KCh2THd4qFKNl4rpQApTTRU/edit#gid=0","personnel":"Rezinator:\nFounder, Global Director of Business Development and Community Management\n\n•\tRezinator leads community management, project development and event hosting/planning for MetaParty.

Our analysis had a number of takeaways but our primary recommendation was to diversify MANA in the treasury into stables. \n\nOur analysis is located here: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a31bfa40-ed02-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d\n\nSubsequently, we proposed that Alastor be appointed to lead a strategy & finance squad, with our first priority being a treasury diversification effort. This proposal was rejected.\n\nSince the release of our initial report on August 12th, the price of Mana has fallen from $1.07 to less than $0.42. To be clear, we did not predict this price drop - but our stance was simply that DCL had uncapped capital downside, putting the prospective runway of the DAO in jeopardy. What was at the time a >$200M treasury (including unvested MANA) is now worth just over $90M. A $20M diversification of vested MANA (our initial proposal outlined in our report) would have saved the DAO ~$12M in value, roughly 100x the compensation we asked for to lead this initiative.\n\nWe would like to ask DCL to once again consider our proposal. Today’s treasury (including unvested MANA) sits at ~$90M, with 99.8% of the value denominated in MANA. $18.5M of that MANA is vested, and we still believe that a large portion of that value should be diversified into stables, to prevent further value loss and to capitalize on the value DCL has created to date.\n\nDecentraland is overexposed, unhedged, and undercapitalized. This was true in August, it’s still true today.\n\nPotential counterparties for diversification include:\n\n-Venture Capital \n\n-Liquid Token Funds\n\n-Market Makers\n\n-DCA using Uniswap v3","specification":"We will contact venture capital firms and liquid token funds to assess if there is a single buyer for the $12MM in MANA.

Builders will be able to save thousands of hours spent on manually creating scenes, assets, avatars, etc.   \n\nHere are some basic use cases we’re planning to integrate with our tool:\n\n**Generating Custom Entities, Components, Actions**\n\n- Run primary queries like “*create a scene with a lot of trees*” and secondary queries like “*add a moving bird everytime a tree is clicked*”\n- Actionable scenes like “*create a drunk zombie*”, “*add unicorns next to the zombie*”, “*a jumping shark*”, “*a jumping shark with a drunk zombie*”, etc.\n- Event based assets like “*party rooms*”, “*sports avenue*”, “*cube jumper*”, etc.\n\nFor the scenes, there will be a split pane, with an editor, and a previewer - code generated through the prompt will be visible on the editor, and the user will be able to see its preview on the previewer, manipulate it, provide feedback, and even publish it to their land by connecting their wallet on DCLBuilderAI. We’ll be using SDK7 for enhanced performance/usability for our project.\n\nWe’ll create a separate pipeline to ingest all the available training data from decentraland scenes repo, SDK, and other public sources, and feed it into the codex da vinci model, fine-tuning for it to work with DCL (and generate valid output) will happen through OpenAI as well. On top of this, by giving the users the option to provide feedback on the accuracy of the results, we’ll be able to optimize feedback loops, decrease statistical errors like type-IIs, and just deliver better content. The model, training, fine-tuning, and api will be part of codex and will come from OpenAI whereas Tensorflow will be used for the data ingestion pipeline process.\n\nNote that this tool will not be assisting with minting and listing assets on the DCL marketplace but will be providing an editor and preview option for working with assets. Besides, the results are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and will hopefully improve over time with the help of the feedback loop.","specification":"The project will require working with a number of key services such as OpenAI, Tensorflow, MetaMask, DCL SDK7, and other web development frameworks/tools. The tool will be used through a web app developed using React for frontend and Node for backend.

Once we’ve exhausted this funding, we will directly charge the end users to foot in the costs for their use cases. \n\nThe rest of the funds will be used as dev salary for our team - we all have skillsets in NLP prompt engineering/model training/data pipelines but would like to bring on board one data scientist/engineer too to help speed up the project development. \n\nThe project will be open-source and we’ll also try to partner with existing projects to help with components like publishing to the lands or making the previewer generate the scene as changes are made to the editor on the fly.

We have an extremely unique setup with our instancing and require some outside skillsets to elevate parts of our infrastructure. Our integration with the Infinity Engine was a huge accomplishment and enhanced Vroomway’s original vision tenfold. We learned a lot with that integration and it has sparked even more innovation on how to develop this going forward. We would like to both upgrade and enhance the current game modes, but also release some community-suggested game modes that we believe will put Vroomway above par with previous racing games in the web3 industry. This new budget also allows the majority of our team to give more full-time attention to the project. \n\n4.5 of our 6 months was building infrastructure. We have achieved nearly everything we set out to achieve and promised that we would. Our team has proven to be efficient with the tight budget and we believe we have produced a unique gaming experience within Decentraland. A few of our more dedicated racers have onboarded new players to our game as well as brand new players to Decentraland. We know that with more time we can scale these efforts! \n\nWe have generated revenue consistently over 4 months and have generated revenue this month (November) as well. The goal is, and always has been, to become fully self-sustaining so that we do not have to rely on future grants and can pay back the ones we do take. We believe we can achieve this with our 2023 goals. \n\nOur game generated over 2,500 MANA sales in wearables (primary and secondary combined). In addition, our players purchased 452 MANA worth of FUEL in-game. \n\nIt’s worth noting that since the beginning of our first grant we vowed to pay 5% of our revenue generated each month back to the DAO until the grant is paid back. We are keeping that vow with this grant as well. We have already shown good faith in this with 4 consecutive months of giving 5% back totaling $155~. Although a small amount, it shows that we can create revenue and eventually pay back the grants in full.\n\n**Goals**\n\n- Scale DAU to 150+ within the next few months and 3x-10x within the next year\n- Consistently generate revenue month-over-month\n- Secure more partnerships\n- More collabs with other games/experiences in DCL\n- Host some of the biggest races in the Metaverse\n- Improve in-game economy\n\n**Budget Breakdown:**\n\nMarketing: $35,000 - 12 months\n\nPersonnel: $108,000 - 12 months\n\nDevelopment: $92,000 - 12 months\n\nHere you can view our **full budget outline**: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gj-R2X15NUio7I6o9jK86OQ9ro9cItKx6rwCTIIw9oI/edit?usp=sharing","personnel":"Nikki Fuego - Founder, Project Manager, Lead 3D Artist:\nhttps://twitter.com/NikkiFuego92\n\nNeocyber - Lead Developer:\nhttps://twitter.com/neocyber_eth\n\nDOCTORdripp - Community Manager:\nhttps://twitter.com/DOCTORdrippNFT\n\nckbubbles - Marketing and PR:\nhttps://twitter.com/iamckbubbles\n\nDoki - Lead 3D Wearable Creator:\nhttps://twitter.com/Doki3D\n\n(Will hire) - Administrative Assistant\n\n(Will hire) - Secondary Developer/Support","roadmap":"**Road Map**\n\nDecember 2022 - February 2023 - $73,400\nPhase 1 - Refactor & Upgrade:\nWe plan to refactor some of our earliest infrastructure for better scene performance.

Because our scene is so unique with instanced scenes, we require a custom setup to understand foot traffic and player interactions. \n\nMarch 2023 - June 2023 - $78,050\nPhase  - New Game Modes and Player Ownership Value:\n\nPlayers have heavily requested two new game modes that are Drag Racing and a new version of our Grand Prix that was held in April of 2022. Drag Racing would be a linear sprint utilizing the infinity engine. It would be a point a to point b sprint with gear-shifting mechanics integrated. \n\nJuly 2023 - December 2023 - $83,750\n\nPhase 3 - Player Economy and Ownership Value:\nWe believe that the players are the most important part of our game aside from the fun factor. With this in mind, we want to always provide value both in the economy and the time spent in-game. We would like to introduce new ways to earn via mini-games that add more value to the main game modes.\n\nSee our **full road map** here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y10DdZyQi8URbv-4GyI0gcBQ6_8RGOanHxQkBi-iOpQ/edit?usp=sharing","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":16623,"scores_total":8379912.385676695,"votes":170,"manaVP":751408.0453966666,"landVP":1200000,"namesVP":208000,"delegatedVP":6174740.3402800225,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5"},{"id":"07a6f1f0-64d0-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d","snapshot_id":"0x1f4dcfd7486937827c1175b7123b7d341a86c7003c2de0f3bc337bb96b268e6f","user":"0xb7433080d23f6ed2390d9c8db98ea61624d55058","type":"grant","title":"Source for starting a career on decentraland","start_at":"2022-11-15T10:26:00.271Z","finish_at":"2022-11-22T10:26:00.271Z","required_to_pass":0,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Source for starting a career on decentraland","abstract":"I would like to mint NFTs.","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":1500,"beneficiary":"0xB7433080D23F6Ed2390d9c8DB98ea61624D55058","email":"kunikmarek@hotmail.com","description":"I am a starting NFT creator","specification":"I am going to make art and show to other people in Decentraland.","personnel":"I colaborate with artists so they help me to create NFTs.","roadmap":"I am going to make a whole collection in the next 12 months.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":16618,"scores_total":2353576.914990266,"votes":72,"manaVP":30299.39290710837,"landVP":316000,"namesVP":181000,"delegatedVP":1793895.5220831572,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 1","size":1500,"beneficiary":"0xB7433080D23F6Ed2390d9c8DB98ea61624D55058"},{"id":"b7a5bb60-5fd8-11ed-9e27-9944727da95a","snapshot_id":"0xfa80458c3077081f724baace4d75d07981f8b750cf35ff5750264686ddba1365","user":"0x9a739c2e212754c3d8432cb717dc9437e5b3dfae","type":"grant","title":"Continued Enhancement of Decentraland VR Clients","start_at":"2022-11-09T02:46:00.702Z","finish_at":"2022-11-23T02:46:00.701Z","required_to_pass":8000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Continued Enhancement of Decentraland VR Clients","abstract":"The team behind Decentraland’s VR client is seeking a grant for continued development of VR support for Decentraland.

The VR client was ported to run natively on the Meta Quest, a significant technical milestone that made Decentraland’s codebase Android compatible. The team brought the PCVR and Quest VR clients to parity with the web/desktop versions of Decentraland by bringing all screen UI and pop-ups into VR and made in-game interactions work with the VR controllers. The VR client team also made stability improvements, implemented a new VR user interface, and made heavy strides towards squashing bugs and incompatibilities related to the Android headset conversion. In this grant proposal, the VR client team seeks to continue maintaining, enhancing features, and improving the performance of the Decentraland VR clients over the next 6 months. \n\n## Summary of proposed work\nA summary of proposed activities is provided in this section, with additional details in the specification section of this proposal.\n\n- **Feature enhancements:** The team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR, and enhancements on the VR user interface. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n- **Improving performance and reliability:** The team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n- **Maintenance:** The team will continue to maintain the VR client over the next 6 months, fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n## Final Remarks\nThe team proposes to build upon previous VR client efforts by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited and grateful to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world!","specification":"## VR Feature Enhancements \nThe team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR, and enhancements on the VR user interface. \n\nUsing hand tracking (instead of controllers) is a more natural way of interacting in the metaverse. A hands-based experience will require some engineering to include items like palm-based menus, selection interactions, teleporting/movement, and other interactions that would otherwise require controller buttons/joysticks. The VR client will still maintain controller support. The hand-tracking update will not replace controller support, but will be an alternative way to interact within Decentraland VR.\n\nWe will also look at enhancing the avatar movements to leverage expanded movement in VR. For example, waving hands, limb movements (crouching), and more avatar movements that follows the user’s physical movement. We will also investigate VRM avatar support. \n\nWe will expand upon the VR UI implement during the previous grant to make it easier to access quick actions like emotes, mic settings, and teleportation to parcels.\n\n## Improving Performance and Reliability\nThe team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs. \n\nThe largest component of this category will be to convert Decentraland existing asset bundle system (currently only set up for the web client / WebGL) and make it android-compatible for the standalone VR clients. This requires close coordination with the Decentraland foundation team and will result in a major improvement in frame rate, memory usage, and overall stability of the VR client. This is because the asset bundles are more optimized than loading in the GLTF models directly.\n\nThe team will also work closely with key Decentraland areas and community members such as the Museum District to ensure that content is VR-friendly and performant.\n\n## Maintenance\nThe team will continue to maintain the Decentraland client for the duration of this grant period (6 months), fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. \n\nAs part of this process, we seek to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the VR client and implement a synchronized release schedule with the primary Decentraland client. \n\nWe will seek to automate this process as much as possible to reduce future manual maintenance needs.","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/","roadmap":"The team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

During this period of time, this team was able to understand the grantees' needs, identified blockers and requests and provided solutions to the community. We have collaborated providing insights to the DAO Committee to [review Voting Power thresholds, the  grant's categories and budget requests to the Grants Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113). \n\nWe've classified the main issues from our grantees into four categories (Tech support, Financial Support, Promotion Support, and others). We wrote the [grant's FAQs](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/grants-faq/), to the DAO documentation to provide responses to recurrent questions. On the other hand, we have started to work on advisorships with the Decentraland Foundation's team to organize frequent calls for the 5 and 6 Tier Grants (platform category), and an [AskMeAnything sessions](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-decentraland-foundation-technical-ask-me-anything-sessions/) to connect the community with the Decentraland Foundation, based on 4 tech support topics (Catalyst, SDK, Explorer, and Dapps). These facilitations will begin in November 2022.\n\nAnother frequent request from our grantees has been promotion. We hired a copywriter (Luis Mienville) to write the #Community Highlights category (with the help of the Decentraland Foundation’s MKT team) on the Decentraland official Blog . We have published 6 articles and our idea is to have more frequency, having Luis as an internal member of the team. We also encouraged the creation of the 2nd monthly Town Halls (on European timezone), to have more grantees showing their progress. Since September, we have an average of 3 grantees showing their progress in each Town Hall, who create videos and chat with the community. Since the beginning of our grant period, 20 projects were highlighted in TownHalls. We work with the Gov Facilitation Squad to spread the videos everytime we can in Social Media, Discord and DAO Newsletter. \n\nTo take care of the community treasury, we have recommended to the DAO committee to revoke grants that were delayed, not delivering their grant projects, or unable to finish due to technical blockers, until they can deliver their commitment with the DAO. We helped to recover more than $565.842 to the DAO treasury during this 5 month period since the Grants Support Squad was created. [We are aware of the negative connotation of this action](https://mirror.xyz/0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5/74SS0fLMzAYS2m3noukxdsfsA3TjmOi3o6fSqolTjpQ) and that this method is not the best. But today, it is the only tool that we have to make sure the funds are going to projects that nurture our community. To decentralize this decision making, we asked who would be the best entity to revoke grants and [the community decided](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=823c92e0-2ad2-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0) to create a Revocation Committee to address these matters. They will be the stewards of the DAO treasury. \n\nLast but not least, we have collaborated with the DAO Facilitation Squad and the DAO Governance Squad to provide them with continuous feedback and partner with them to generate synergy among our efforts to build transparency in the community.","specification":"For this renewal, here are the goals, background, activities and methods we’d like to implement:\n\n\n**Support the grantees in Decentraland to make successful projects:** \nWe have supported +100 grantees, solving more than 80 requests and blockers and in the next 6 months we want to continue with this goal in mind, creating better and longer partnerships with the community. We are doing this by onboarding the new grantees, meeting virtually to provide support, constant communication on Discord/email, facilitating contacts, and creating strong relationships between Decentraland Foundation and our grantees to address blockers and requests. \n\n**Fostering transparency in the grants ecosystem:**\nIn the next 6 months, we want to keep on building along with the Governance App Squad a friendly platform for our grantees to post updates, communicate, receive feedback, support and review their project´s progress.\nOn this renewal, [we will work on requests for changes](https://www.figma.com/file/tL5dgm0VKP4J1JgSaHraPz/New-Grant-Request-Flow?node-id=0%3A1) to the form for requesting grants, that follow the Grants Framework, with the objective of giving the DAO more information about the grant being requested to have better context for voting. We are also requesting to implement a Final Report for the grants finished,  to understand how our grantees add value to Decentraland, and how our Grants program adds value to the community contributors. Measuring these impacts will help us understand the changes needed to make the Grants Program better in the future.\n\n\n**Guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury:**\nWe have been able to advise the DAO committee to execute preventive revocations for projects. This has been a difficult position, as it created friction on our relationship with some of our grantees. Nevertheless, all preventive revocations have been done with the commitment from the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee that if the grantees demonstrate that they deliver their projects, their vesting contracts would be resumed and paid fully. In this next period of 6 months, we will continue our efforts to design a [Framework for New Committee who decides when to revoke grants](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-275c146-framework-for-new-committee-who-decides-when-to-revoke-grants/16339), to provide transparency, decentralize the role of the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee, and start our role as providers of information to the New Committee. \n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.\nThe proposed DAO Grant Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet.

The genre is so popular that fans have made variants of tower defence in nearly every RTS game that offers modding capabilities; some of these fan projects have even pivoted to become full standalone games (now that is dedication!). Decentraland has seen several different types of games break into the scene over the course of the platform’s development, but the foundations for tower defence games have never been cemented. I see this as a major missed opportunity not only for players, but also for creators and land owners within Decentraland.\n\nThe value provided by this project would benefit 3 major audiences: users, creators, and land owners. The created tower defence game fields would provide general users of Decentraland with a fun activity to partake in, while the developed creation kit could be used by creators to generate additional tower defence content. Land owners would be able to leverage the kit by hosting tower defence games on their land, likely monetizing access to premium content or wearables themed around their fields. On top of that, if we can achieve a baseline ecosystem for developing a self-propelling system of user developed content we would be able to apply that blueprint to other game genres.\n\nThis project will also provide important jobs and invaluable experience to Decentraland community creators. It is absolutely imperative that our community’s skill-level and proficiency in creating for the Decentraland platform is fostered and continues to grow. If developers cannot source resource creation from our community: they will either go elsewhere or choose to conduct their projects in a more developed metaverse. The deliverable tower and enemy assets outlined in this project will be developed and optimised specifically for the platform, giving an in-depth example of how to make assets for Decentraland.\n\nThe tower defence creation kit will provide everything a user needs to create their own tower defence field (from tower placement to enemy wave generation). The interfaces will be as simplified as possible and heavily documented to ensure users with no coding experience can still create their dream TD fields. The kit will also come pre-packed with the required assets to create a tower defence game (enemies, towers, etc), all for unlimited free use.\n\nAfter development of the kit has completed, four tower defence fields will be made using the creation kit. These game fields will be made available as open-source repositories, as well as being hosted for play by any user in Decentraland. This will allow any user looking to host a tower defence field on their land to do so with minimal effort. It also provides a great starting point for anyone looking to create their own tower defence field, as users will be free to customise/monitise these scenes or any derived scenes in any way they wish.\n\nIf we can capture the attention of even a small portion of the gaming audience by providing entertaining experiences and empowering tools then that would be a huge win for our community. By nurturing a thriving community of players and creators, we would see the constant generation of new content to attract more users to Decentraland. As we break into new genres of gaming the community (and amount of accessible content in Decentraland) would only grow. While this will likely take significant time and effort, we can begin to lay the foundations for community-based games now.","specification":"### Tower Defence Kit Assets:\n\nThe kit will include a set of standard assets for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. These will be designed to be as light-weight while still maintaining a quality appearance, ensuring in-scene resources are not misspent and acceptable performance can be maintained. Everything included in the creation kit will also be open source and made completely available to the community for use in other projects or games (including monetized scenes).\n\nThese assets will include vital components (models, animations, etc) following a single systemic doctrine that, when followed, would allow additional assets to easily be added to the module by users. Their raw pieces (such as UVs, textures, and .blend) will also be made available along-side the project in an additional compressed file. These resources will be extremely useful to anyone looking to modify existing assets or developing their own assets for the creation kit.\n\n### Tower Defence Kit Functionality:\nThe kit will provide all required functionality for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. The interfaces for the kit should be easy to interact with and as hands-off as possible, enabling creators who do not have programming experience.\n\n#### Proposed Functionality:\n   - Tower Management: de/construction and upgrade towers that interact with enemies via classic tower defence mechanics (ie: direct damage, damage over time, movement slow).\n   - Enemy Management: enemy wave generation and spawn handling, as well as handling enemy entity specifics such as health, movement, and death.\n   - Economy Management: earn points by defeating enemies and clearing waves; spend points on building new towers and fortifying existing ones.\n   - Difficulty Management: modify the game’s ecosystem with variances to provide more/less challenge through different difficulties. (An additional feature I'd like to add, if I everything goes smoothly, is the inclusion of challenge modes where the player must complete game fields under certain constraints; something like 1-life mode).\n\nThroughout development modularity will remain a key requirement of the kit. While most users will likely be satisfied with the provided features, others might want to add their own functions/assets to the project. This process must be made as easy as possible: adding new assets to the project (such as towers and enemies) should require very little effort and only minimal knowledge of programming. Assets will be loaded at run-time through definition files targeting external assets, meaning users will only need to interact with a json file in order to add more turrets or enemies to the mix.\n\n### Tower Defence Fields:\nFour playable tower defence fields will also be produced with the tower defence creation kit during the project’s course. These will not only showcase the kit’s functionality, but also provide an example of how to put a tower defence game together. Like the creation kit, these playable fields will be provided through open-source GitHub repositories. Instances of these scenes will also be hosted and maintained so users can play some Decentraland Tower Defence anytime they wish!\n\nAs with previous projects, all produced content will be monitored and maintained to keep them relevant and functional within the Decentraland platform. Further features may be targeted and developed by request as the project progresses.","personnel":"Hi, I’m Alex; I’ll be managing the development process, as well as tackling the module's programming implementation.\n\nI've been programming and developing projects for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community. I have already created several projects on the platform and I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the goals of this project is to provide an opportunity for Decentraland’s creators to showcase their talents. With that in mind, I’ve on-boarded some talented community members who will be working on generating the project’s graphical assets!\n\nArtist Core:\n   CG-KING -  (Instagram)[https://www.instagram.com/mabanoking/]\n   Emilie\n   Jacko\n   Ottonamas\n   Jetrolee\n   Finegrapgh\n\nI feel this is the best direction to take in regards to the creation and composition of the project’s team. This orientation will not only provide the most utility-to-cost, but also enables Decentraland’s community creators and directly aligns with the results of previous community polling. After the module has been successfully developed and tested (at the close of this proposal’s term), we’ll be able to consider populating the creation kit with additional industry-grade assets.","roadmap":"During development bi-weekly reports (every 2 weeks) on current progress and targeted goals will be published to the community.  As this project is very much for the community, feedback and suggestions on current/additional features will also be taken under serious consideration for inclusion in the project.\n\n### STAGE 0 - Viability\nThis phase has already been conducted. Design documents have been prepared, these outline the systems and assets required for the module. Artists have also been screened and on-boarded.\n\n### STAGE 1 - TD Creation Kit Development\n#### Estimated Length - 2 months\n#### Allocated Budget - 23.8k\n##### - Project/Community Management: 1.2k\n##### - Programming: 11.2k\n##### - Visual Design: 11.4k\nDuring the initial stage, development of the creation kit’s primary utilities and the production of the required standard assets will be conducted.\n\n### STAGE 2 - Playable Field Creation\n#### Estimated Length - 4 months\n#### Allocated Budget - 10.4k\n##### - Project/Community Management: 2.4k\n##### - Programming: 3.2k\n##### - Visual Design: 4.8k\nAfter the TD Creation Kit has been developed to a satisfactory point, work will begin on the planned tower defence fields.\n\n### STAGE 3 - Deployment\nThe final stage will see the release of the tower defence creation kit and all playable tower defence fields as open-source repositories for everyone in the community. These repositories will be monitored for any missed features/bugs and amended with their addition/removal.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":16497,"scores_total":3152033.555384117,"votes":76,"manaVP":87389.63967389529,"landVP":488000,"namesVP":225000,"delegatedVP":2310576.915710222,"vesting_address":"0x686F306527b08e256f5Cd8FE96169b47a45Cbb16","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 4","size":34200,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","token":"DAI","vesting_released":16935.647800925926,"vesting_releasable":1019.6930555555556,"vesting_start_at":"2022-11-21T22:17:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-05-20T22:17:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":17264.352199074074,"vesting_total_amount":34200,"vesting_status":"In Progress","done_updates":3,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"update_status":"pending","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-02-21T05:59:09.639Z","next_update":"2023-03-21T22:17:02.788Z","pending_updates":3},{"id":"2d49ad30-5eb8-11ed-9128-d95e3b6d7912","snapshot_id":"0x12fe59cfddf4a18f416bcdfb05be8539722fc087407202a8670ca165cb818707","user":"0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406","type":"grant","title":"Support DCL Reporters and Improve Content Quality","start_at":"2022-11-07T16:21:00.515Z","finish_at":"2022-11-21T16:21:00.515Z","required_to_pass":2000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Support DCL Reporters and Improve Content Quality","abstract":"Coming into our 4th revision of our proposal we have reduced our request by 75%, and retained only the costs necessary to maintain our operations while focusing on the one thing that matters most: Content Quality. \n\nWe have also established our rewards system automation, and approved a 10% royalty return from The DCL Report to DCL DAO\n\nSince January 2021 The Decentraland Report has been a platform for community members to join as reporters and preserve the history of the metaverse.

As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse. \n\nTo prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in security, user retention and scalability. \n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse. Rather than request $240k at once to build this as well as optimize our quality systems, we broke this up into segmented efforts. \n\nThis is our 4th revision of this particular grant proposal as in the first 3 versions we seeked to do “Quality” and “Reach” efforts at once. After hearing community feedback, we will break this down into staged efforts, where currently quality is going to be the only focus. \n\nOur decentralized news network is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage and amplify their voice in the metaverse. \n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report. We have budgeted this grant funding to elevate the overall content quality to help the ecosystem and reach a community size where we can maintain our monthly operational costs (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director).","specification":"Crafted content by DCL Subject Matter Experts explaining how to access ecosystem value will be used posting across our channels.\n\nTo address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established. Through a strategic partnership with Xpand.GG, The DCL Report retains 90% of revenue from donations and recurring subscriptions on our community page. Through our Xpand powered Community Page, we can automatically divide revenues across our team as well as our royalty payment to the DCL DAO. We will also pursue long term sponsor partnerships which can allow for more sustainable capital infusions to maintain operations.\n\nWith essential infrastructure to support our growth in place, we envision attracting like minded creators who will be positive contributing members of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nThe style of our content will aim to attract individuals within the following demographic:\nAges 20 - 40 \nIndividuals Interested/Active in Web3 & Metaverse\nUniversity/Higher Education Student & Faculty\nBackgrounds in Computer Science, Design, Music, and Art \n\nWe will focus on posting content within relevant contexts and social channels (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, IRL events). \n\nWhile content is hosted on each Reporters individual channels, content is also now hosted across DCL Report social and content channels. The budget allocation below is a framework for spending which will allow us to optimize content, ultimately reach our goals in content quality and community size which would enable us to acquire sponsors that could offer sustainable capital for operations. \n\nWeekly Reporter Generated Micro-Content for Social Channels for 6 months ($3k/reporter, 6 Total Reporters) \n$18,000\n\nLead Video Editor (7 Individual Report Videos, and 1 highlight Video/week)\n$24,000\n\nCross Channel Content Manager\n$16,000\n\nMetaverse Quiz Giveaway Prizes\n$2,000\n\nTOTAL\n$60,000\n\n\nFunds managed via a Multi Signature Wallet via Gnosis-Safe.io; 3 wallet owners, 2 managed by KevinOnEarth and 1 by CEO of Xpand Alek.

As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse. \n\nTo prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in security, user retention and scalability. \n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse. Rather than request $240k at once to build this as well as optimize our quality systems, we broke this up into segmented efforts. \n\nThis is our 3rd revision of this particular grant proposal as in the first 2 versions we seeked to do “Quality” and “Reach” efforts at once. After hearing community feedback, we will break this down into 2 efforts, where currently quality is going to be the only focus. We will be led by none other than Pink Bambii (Imen Maaroufi, of Pink & Shades) who’s focus will be managing our team, meetings, personnel changes, documents for transparency, content planning, etc. Previously this was taken on by KevinOnEarth, but to offer diverse leadership and new ideas PinkBambii honorably takes on this role after nomination from the DCL Reporters.\n\nOur decentralized news network is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage and amplify their voice in the metaverse. \n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report. We have budgeted this grant funding to elevate the overall content quality to help the ecosystem and reach a community size where we can maintain our monthly operational costs (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director).","specification":"To address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established. Through a strategic partnership with Xpand.GG, The DCL Report retains 90% of revenue from donations and recurring subscriptions on our community page. Through our Xpand powered Community Page, we can automatically divide revenues across our team as well as our royalty payment to the DCL DAO. We will also pursue long term sponsor partnerships which can allow for more sustainable capital infusions to maintain operations.\n\nWith essential infrastructure to support our growth in place, we envision attracting like minded creators who will be positive contributing members of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nThe style of our content will aim to attract individuals within the following demographic:\nAges 20 - 40 \nIndividuals Interested/Active in Web3 & Metaverse\nUniversity/Higher Education Student & Faculty\nBackgrounds in Computer Science, Design, Music, and Art \n\nWe will focus on posting content within relevant contexts and social channels (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, IRL events). \n\nWhile content is hosted on each Reporters individual channels, content is also now hosted across DCL Report social and content channels. The budget allocation below is a framework for spending which will allow us to optimize content, ultimately reach our goals in content quality and community size which would enable us to acquire sponsors that could offer sustainable capital for operations. \n\n\nWeekly Reporter Generated Micro-Content for Social Channels for 6 months ($4k/reporter, 6 Total Reporters): $24,000\n\nLead Video Editor (7 Individual Report Videos, and 1 highlight Video/week): $24,000\n\nProgram Manager: $24,000\n\nReporter Equipment (Camera, Lighting, Microphone; $2,000/reporter): $12,000\n\nCross Channel Content Manager: $16,000\n\nIRL Event Presence and Attendance Budget (4 events attended): $10,000\n\nChief Newsletter Editor: $6,000\n\n6 Months of “MetaMoments Wearables” Giveaways: $4,000\n\nTOTAL: $120,000\n\n\nFunds managed via a Multi Signature Wallet via Gnosis-Safe.io; 3 wallet owners, 2 managed by KevinOnEarth and 1 by CEO of Xpand Alek. This is done to prevent hacking and transparent tracking of fund use and disbursement. \n\nWe are a Decentralized News Network that will always be owned by the decentralized community! By watching and joining our community they will earn rewards, learn how to navigate the metaverse effectively, and use the $REPORT tokens acquired to have their projects covered in the news when they decide to release work themselves.\n\nIn addition we will also reinitiate our MetaMoment Wearables monthly drops. The cost breakdown for this is $300-$500 to the wearable creator depending on quality or complexity, like, top. Then ~$200 for the publishing, and then the Reporter who captures the picture that is voted the MetaMoment of the month, that we create the wearable after, is given $250 as a prize. Another incentive for Reporters to capture good stuff during their stream to get that prize.\n\nWe will also execute a strategy around event attendance and an IRL presence through speaking engagements, which will bolster networking opportunities to connect with individuals inside the web3 space, but also individuals outside of Decentraland seeking to discover web3 possibilities in the “real-world”. \n\nThe events which we are targeting include: DCentralMiami, ETH San Francisco, Consensus, International Conference on Internet of Things Based on Blockchain (ICIOTBB), Blockchain Africa Conference.","personnel":"Operations\nFounder - KevinOnEarth999 (www.ImagineOnEarth.com) \nProgram Manager - PinkBambii (https://pinkandshades.com/) \nGraphic Designer/3D modeler - Sango of the East \nCGI and Animations - Cinetica.Studios\nLead Video Editor - Nadim\nContent Manager - Stefan\nChief Newsletter Editor - Lena\n \nReporters\nKevinOnEarth NFTuesdays - Tuesdays from 11PM UTC to Wednesday 12AM UTC  & Thursdays from 11PM UTC to Friday 12AM  https://www.twitch.tv/KevinOnEarth999\n\nMetaTrekkers - Wednesdays from 1AM UTC to 2AM UTC \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/metatrekkers \n\nFriskyBumbleBee - Wednesdays from 11PM UTC to Thursday https://www.twitch.tv/friskybumblebee \n\nMoustafa - Thursdays from 4PM UTC to 5PM UTC \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/MoustafaSb \n\nFabinho - Fridays from 11PM UTC to Saturday 12AM UTC \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fabinhodcl \n\nIna_DCL - Saturdays from 6PM UTC to 7PM UTC \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/ina_dcl\n\nReporters get rewarded as of now in a few ways:\n- 1 of 100 wearable Report #13\n- 1 of 1 Wearable Report #26\n- Even revenue share of Xpand donations\n- $REPORT tokens weekly\n- Retain all of their own channel revenues, and sponsor fees.","roadmap":"To see our progress to date you can take a look at our Gitbook: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/ \n\nWe conducted various surveys and analysis across our platform.

Aspects ranging from economy, health, data, politics among others are top notch aspects that need to be addressed by many African countries if not all, the question has always been how? With what?. Blockchain offers the answer to these questions which is so evident with a few problems that have been addressed with a few years of integration of blockchain in Africa, the best example is DeFi, the money sector has greatly been influenced with blockchain offering, fast, secure, low fees transactions across Africa and the entire Globe, thus greatly impacting the economy despite the fact that some states are reluctant to incorporate blockchain for fear of losing control, which is why Blockchain is the best option to address many of problems faced with Africa. \nThe underlying factor is, how can the Blockchain help address these problems, it is known to everyone that the blockchain tech is so diverse and so specific places with specific problems at hand would chose a specific blockchain use case that would address the problem which calls for identifying the problem that needs to be solved.\n  \nHowever, knowing the problems the world is facing and having the urge to solve them isn’t enough. To solve these problems takes more than just blockchain, it takes using the best blockchain ecosystem that provides a set of services that can be leveraged on by a diverse community, not limited to anything  Decentralland does not only offer storage clouds but also exposes one to the metaverse world, marketplace of digital assets, number of user applications, the best software framework, low fees and fast transactions, transparency and inclusivity leaving out no one. Uganda in this case, the young generation I have interacted with before has so much enthusiasm and passion to exploit the opportunity that has come with blockchain, many of them are involved in NFT projects, gaming, developing and coding, content creation among others however having a place where they can actualize, profit and get value from their creation is the question,  which is why with pride I would love to bring DCL to my community weighing that it is the best ecosystem I would love the community to interact with. So, this grant aims at aiding the process of introduction of DCL to the Student Community in Uganda. More to the introduction is to help these newly introduced students on how to use the different use cases on the DCL ecosystem.\n\n Student communities have been largely untapped by web3 communities, but they hold the key to spreading the word about DCL amongst their friends and longer term becoming potential recruits as DCL developers and advocates, consumers of the already made services. Establishing a strong community in this demographic will give DCL a clear first-mover advantage that will pay forward huge rewards in a short period of time. More to this is to onboard about 300 students in the DCL community, with a skill set of how to use different use cases on DCL.","specification":"This is to a be a series of events leading to one big event,  reason being that every other student should be given chance to be indoctrinated to the DCL ecosystem, so, I aim at having a series of 5 five events, I intend hosting the first 4 events in different off city Universities, by this I mean I will have an event at Mbarara University of Science and Technology, with approximately 100 students, Kabale University with approximately 50-100 students, Gulu University with approximately 100 students, Uganda Christian University with approximately 80 students, and finally host the big event that I intend to have all students from the city, with Makerere University, Kyambogo University, Kampala International University, East African International University, Bugema University, and some other different stakeholders in the city like the Motiv Innovation Hub with an approximate number of 200-250 students.

This module currently provides all functions required for users to create their own parkour stages in Decentraland. Parkour stages can be made up of several different platform types (static, moving, rotating, and blinking) and can be separated across several different sets (allowing for different difficulties of the same stage). \n\nThe proposed expansion would add in-scene collectibles, death mechanics, and a checkpoint respawn system to the current list of features. Creators would be able to use these systems to gamify their stages by providing completion challenges and respawn locations for when the player reaches a failure point (e.g. falling in lava).","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","email":"thecryptotrader69@gmail.com","description":"Parkour is prevalent throughout the internet and gaming culture. It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts; developing this module further would enhance the experience that can be created through this kit.\n\nYou can view the module here: [Repo](https://github.com/TheCryptoTrader69/Decentraland_ParkourKit) and [Live Scene](https://decentraland-parkour-kit.herokuapp.com/)\n\nThe current set of features allows users to fully create their own parkour stages. The module’s implementation also massively reduces the level of programming knowledge required to create their own stages. However, the module currently lacks game elements associated with the parkour/platformer genre, such as collectible objects and death/respawn mechanics. These elements can be successfully reproduced in tandem with the module, but are not baked into the kit and many users will likely lack the required skills needed to craft these features on their own.\n\nThis proposal is meant to remedy those gaps by providing access to those systems in a similar manner to the platform creation interface. Users would be able to define and place collectibles (coins, relics) around their parkour courses, create traps/zones to kill players, and checkpoints for the player to respawn at when they are killed; all through the modification of simple files.","specification":"This module currently allows users to set up dynamic parkour courses made up of varying platform types. The relatively complex systems that make up these core utilities have been hidden from the user by providing them with simple interfaces to define and generate their platforms for the parkour stage. By providing the power of the SDK through interfaces, users can take advantage of its power without requiring advanced programming knowledge. Advanced users can also easily modify the module to fit their own needs by adding new platform visual styles or movement types.\n\nThe planned features for this expansion are:\n\n   Collectibles System: users will be able to define and place collectibles around their parkour stages. Collectibles can be defined in different tiers/types, allowing users to place higher tier collectibles in hard to reach locations. These will be placed in the game space and collected when a player touches them. The system will also provide a count of gathered and remaining collectibles on the player’s HUD, providing the player with feedback on how much of the course remains and when it has been successfully completed.\n\n   Death Mechanics and Respawn System: Users will be able to create deadly traps/death zones around their stages to defeat players and provide respawn locations for the player. Checkpoints can also be used to modify player respawn locations (allowing players to save their progress as they adventure through the parkour stage).\n\n   A scene will also be produced using the module to showcase these features and providing an example of how to create a parkour stage with the kit. The current theme of the scene is Jungle Temple, featuring 2 tiers of in-game collectibles and several trap types (e.g. spikes, blow darts). This scene will be hosted along-side the current example scene, through its own repository (the more content/examples the better).","personnel":"I'll be working on this project individually.

As this project is proposing here, the user case will be DCL. The book will not only bring people to experience the city, streets, lands, buildings, avatar, wearables, arts, events, moving, seeing, acting etc. in the new world, but also teach people to understand the underlying logic of FT, NFT, DAO, smart contract, governmental token, DeFi, P2E etc.\n\nThis project will benefit DCL in many aspects, at least including:  \n* Reach 1.4 billion people who are mostly clueless but eager to know about metaverse;  \n* Lift DCL industry fame world-widely;  \n* Open a permanent and high-quality channel to absorb new user steams;  \n* Lay the foundation of people’s understanding in DCL as the most classic metaverse in the world;  \n* Much more potential opportunities in the future.  \n\nTo fulfill this task, we need your supports on the grant to cover part of related expenses including Team compensation, operational cost, expert consultation fee, publishing cost, etc.","specification":"What we have done:  \n- [x] We have entered a contract with China Machine Press (CMP) to publish “The underlying logic of the metaverse” within 6 months.

Performing well over 200 Shows for the past 3 Years we would like Serena Elis World to be centered around performing Arts and collaborations. * Opened for Dj Aluna , Crypto Chicks, Performed coexistence with Grimes. Parcel is at Aetheria District 83,74. Where she performers her weekly events. With sold out collection on Ethereum Network “Beauty in Chaos plans to expand its utility. These works of art can be expanded to 3D skins and Avatars, as they are multi-Function. They are functional in programs like Unreal Engine, Maya or Blender.\nIn Serena Elis World we want to expand our vision of what is possible in entertainment Music, so far we have crated music notes wearables, and have other emotes in the works that are designed for the development for this project.\n\nWhat will we develop?\n\n*Expanding Serena Elis World (83,74):\n6 New Female Performers to perform on parcel to diversity in Entertainment. Different Builder Model for Parcel to cater to all artists. Have wearables be used as utility to represent the voices, ideas for women in Decentraland. \nEducation and Resources for All Artists. Education and information with Vlogs, Blogging and streaming. \nA Stage/Gallery and Shop: For Events and Promotion. \n*IRL event Set up for Education/Resources with flyers, and QR Code with Links to all the collected info and Resources during a IRL Performance from Serena Elis in Florida. \n\n\nHow will it be sustainable?\nOur plan is to have New Artists at least 2 times a month. As an entertainer it’s important to keep it fresh and new with new music, energy and vibes to keep the community excited. Not only will I find entertainers, I will also perform with them, giving them support with their first time experience and Guiding them through. We need more females to balance out the community. We want to bring a variety of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and culture so users can feel like they have someone to relate to. We know the importance of inclusion. I will be adding value by writing blogs 2 times a week to help the algorithm on google and reaching web 2 and 3 readers to educate on metaverse opportunities and brand expansion.\n\nOnce we have have it all running we will generate income by:\n\nWearables NFT Sales\nSelling merch Education Resources\n Videos and Blogs from social Platforms. \n\nThe funds from DAO would allow me to perform and bring more education and resources to the community. To also bring new energy or creatives within the space, who can potentially become long term entertainers in the future. Create A sustainable place safe haven to get started. As an artist myself with experience  I understand both view points which is beneficial. \nWe can later present to users a way to learn as well with courses. We understand DCL Is filled with plenty of creative people who would like to learn more about art and music. We need more resources to make it sustainable for users to stay.","specification":"Budget - $4,992 $416/week for 3 Months.

Searching for a suitable topic for my masters thesis, I wanted to use this opportunity to do something nobody did before (I think). By asking the DAO to fund my scientific mark research, I want to work fulltime on providing value to Decentraland and it's creators.\n\nThe idea is to develop and formulate proper questionaires and do a research on the userbase on decentraland. A scientific approach is enforced by the University I am currently enroled in and brings a certain level of quality and effort into this research (it is my masters degree).\n\nAfter presenting the results of my own research, I want to provide a framework, which enables creators to do similar questionaires and ultimately collect valuable feedback through beautiful user interfaces and easy-to-setup backends (+data storage) from inside the Metaverse.","specification":"This Masters thesis is about analysing the userbase of decentraland and propose an opensource framework for creators and brands to use to better understand and target existing and potential customers within their virtual experiences.\n\nBy using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews, questionaires, blockchain analysis, live calls, ingame interfaces) I want to find answers to some of the most difficult questions: \nWho are the different  decentraland players (users, creators, developers, comittee, staff), what is their motivation, expectations, dreams and fears. The results of this research should help shine a light on the mayority as well as minorities in the decentraland community to better understand their needs and ultimately create a better experience for everyone.\n\nThe second part of this proposal consists of designing and developing an easy-to-setup  interface for creators to use on their parcels and continue the research beyond this scientific research.","personnel":"Domo aka.

In order to do so, I need to rent land, develop a built (2000$) and hire my friend and decentraland wearable creator Metadojo (https://twitter.com/MetaDojo) to design a user interface and optimize the user experience for visitors and land owners (3000$). Furthermore, different forms of rewards will be used to drive attention and participation on the project. Several wearables will be designed and created by famous creators like Michi Todd (2000$ + submission fees).

The work and content creation efforts to date brought Decentraland the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse. \n\nThe DCL Report didn’t just impact and change the way we interacted and shared immersive experiences but also how we created value. To prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in user retention and scalability. \n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse. \n\nOur decentralized news network, by creators for creators, is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland and how to be part of it. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage. \n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report all along the journey. We have budgeted this grant funding accounting for our needs for our biggest awareness campaign yet to reach creators around the world (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director), and the goals it will enable within the timeline needed to become sustainable financially and prove our model moving forward.\n\nTo address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established.

While there are a few places in Decentraland where users can participate in card games, there are very few resources for the community to use when developing or deploying their own card games. By providing better access to modules for developing entertainment content we could further cement Decentraland as one of the best places to participate in metaverse gaming.\n\nCurrently the community card game module provides all the utilities required to manage collections of cards (hands, decks, stacks, and slides) and create 3D card games within Decentraland. The main system creates game tables that can host several different types of card games and an effort has been made to optimise the code to reduce the strain on scene resources. The module also features two fully incorporated card games (Patience and FreeCell Solitaire), showcasing its current functionality.\n\nBy expanding the community card game module and adding additional card games we can further test the limitation of the current set of utilities, as well as providing more content for the platform. With the development of card games that have more unique rulesets we can also ensure that the module has robust functionality before making it multiplayer (It will save a lot of time finding underdeveloped areas before we begin adding netcode).

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Therefore, for an ordinary user, Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from them - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Previous proposal ###\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=12f794f0-167a-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8\n\n### TL;DR changes in the resubmission ###\n\nThe updated budget focuses on creating a demo version to demonstrate the gameplay\n\n### Examples of game assets ###\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join it. The purpose of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a lot of new users to Decentraland.\n\nDungeons and Dragons inspired the game we want to create. But it won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some game mechanics so that it fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience. \n\n### Scope ###\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~ 2 months. We want to release a demo version of our game during this period.\n\n### Duration ###\n\nThe demo's duration will be short (~ 10 minutes) but intense. During this time, users will get familiar with the main mechanics, various 3D models, animation, and sound design.\n\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7EB5l6wYrQHUMBKflUXrE0W4doMiOe6x7XZngXmmsWSLC9MD_Ckme2jDb37mrCRsBJYcbuaCjl_KtKRss6U5GX93en814fWk4WWjMMKhOvWQ2ypYH-BEjhiIR5rdWSthFoo43pKP9Gpv0adklWXlSjePiZVTHu0ZR43PaAnoPQJgxSu_DFRwDwH9cxsmvWJWbpb8EvEQFRMqrGSkIwltB5LcQMImKEm7ah6jVMSIoFMq0GsV3ybVIM3oXlOv96hA7fRKDWdfzTnxKXVJ0iv3iwic7aWSsA-gtBQ8kkcamc6dSJiaBbIba33C1FA1QvlVoLDJuoFLSFCudzLqkdbyGs51ZUOBAthM21eca4v5PQgEZZsJuoPEW3znY8oBZxXpt2Lb8j3dTXW3yHGyh9u7JFcxkya1FrTx3hx_GM_sqHCaI-e58KIHPS6zsdZOHRhjc1_5sS-wdzyT92Rnf1pn4S-ozvJ0q5jpEX1fRuwoqWu0YskM6jvCRI-CTgHw6zRN8PmJYNoFHlBvZZOkjjIHU3yL8Fw4lBRsNm4M-Bs0eKQiOqEVzPLljB1fdlXE-UIKEodKJaBPDsUe4ajLYA9clfoIhb-XTmAYFjTKW9DEr93LtmcYW9-r1amv1WuYq7UtYb3SitV3TGBqCmb0W1ji1f03IRGdRiRFTcjXYxSRr4Po-AMZ5n6NMkdMwmDqwvMGravsEZS1d4u5kxYS-UFdewt6rc8eGiLpkqJrWbZDWafLydxKlefYmUzDl1dIgGnaEUd2e4QeVJvzYjpk-wo3W3nk4T-dXOodxqGiHq7oV-5jRPPo6pWYRx36OWWeYOhjpq9LJgNc8FH8DQAER31cQELhRTFKaNN9ly8ketZmigiVD4aCcbNFXw_nWlQPKrdvZ2nkorFHrN0LOoaNlphyjUajD5f3MzpDYznrpw6yvIfbMaNS7zZohy16Nf7l4dMMk9xCl2gdMus=w725-h940-no?authuser=1)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R2mRAshZLTtMkBkLr8Y8y7_cYmHSSnAnjU9Z5J64qTfwqAGLKG4okCdfZ7-ROYTFxwBXGh3UxogM1ZTnBcUjTmK440WOWsYKnJANgBa8Kk1Ne2oGi5hbPc2TTpBcD07cHSbX4zEeOBP62usewJkfhqD1AnuTkxbgkTljnICaJ8TXLdFo8iu-Cqb4LBtv8SDtReEgXDznyTA8OAnm1wA942NfhXM28ufF1ITuJ-BPqnilykzT1SMwWjlJsZS_-BjiOzpNgMxpuSWWqU0Umwmj_bkQ6QV1i1cZodsHFbRDKw7WeGowDwdqDQzgojRB8QwtkV5cCT7SMpzjqjCJby2a7vEHz5ixVMHLGKei0XEHGwBXv5CnKAoBpRmIAkIAhxbABSabU4kc0XSc6ZIjWJ3VZQvf3u3Jdo_JWV8jhwnMBLoLaLdUc5Xf2I0QtMUNmjjqHCMOrnA0o2ENILFPrCRiGp1RxRQ-g-AcuBERHoNoRLSzlWHdkQAfUQ7BAwnpK24eF7RjITfojoha48vwyaKjlL51nzi5oDh0YLxW5KiX9nCEnM-P6taYic7q29TvVnJdPozqYdfpGoMyszIIfj-ViDe_WNzZqntyDNQ4UFCuqwjNGc_YW_NYbZfvktL8yqBaBJkgdWegjFTJarbo7zl89QhpXfTpY8a7RcGKwuTAMlBYvCA1AsfbeqAtjIKVlg1QBUxUGCNNJbazy48sl5VP6dJB3TSw90tP_CfSipfgtDavWUZKbnrPloYph7iWwBMxrWSXrmqHdOS2g-qbN220CODXf-qb4nAx=w725-h940-no?authuser=1)","specification":"### How we see the final result: ###\n\nThe player enters the adventurers guild.

For the first time, Decentraland creators could use VR to build fully functioning, interactive scenes for parcels without any code or any knowledge of the Decentraland SDK. This vastly lowered the barrier for Decentraland content creation and provided an increase in opportunities for creators without any technical or programming experience. The team exceeded the grant’s proposed deliverables by also implementing a state-of-the art code converter that allowed users to use Byldr’s no-code logic blocks to create interactive scenes for Decentraland, by automatically converting Byldr’s JSON-based logic to Decentraland’s TypeScript-based logic. [See a showcase video here presented during a DAO town hall meeting.](shorturl.at/acFI9)  \n\n## Proposed Grant\n\nSince introducing the Decentraland export feature to Byldr, the Byldr team has received positive feedback as well as requests for further expand upon Byldr’s Decentraland support.\n\nThe development team seeks to build upon the previous achievements by submitting the current grant proposal. The proposed expansions to Byldr covered by this grant proposal includes:\n- Additional no-code logic blocks for greater flexibility in interactive scene creation \n- Expanding the creator tool beyond VR so that it also supports 2D platforms (desktop computer) to embrace a broader user base and further democratize development \n- Increasing robustness of Byldr’s Decentraland support to   accommodate future SDK changes.\n- The ability to download the Decentraland scene source code for any Decentraland scenes created using Byldr, to provide creators with additional flexibility and ownership over their parcel’s content.\n\nAdditional details for proposed enhancements are provided in the Specification section of this grant proposal. \n\nThe Byldr development team is excited for the opportunity work with DAO and the Decentraland community to expand upon our trusted immersive creation experience for Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR and metaverse future for all generations to come.","specification":"The development team seeks to build upon its previous achievements by submitting the current grant proposal. The proposed enhancements to Byldr covered by this grant proposal include:\n\n- **Additional no-code logic blocks for greater flexibility in interactive scene creation.** This includes adding support for action-trigger pairs such as collision triggers, ability to select a keystroke or specific VR button as a trigger, and increased Decentraland support for existing Byldr features such as physics, parenting, solvers, and more.\n- **Expanding the creator tool beyond VR so that it also supports 2D platforms (desktop computer) in order to have a larger impact and availability.** A common feedback received is that while creating in an immersive environment is efficient and exciting, the lack of a 2D/desktop client for Byldr limits the adoption of the platform to only those with VR hardware. The Byldr team seeks to further lower barriers for creators by porting our experience to run on computers instead of only VR headsets.\n- **Increasing robustness of Byldr’s Decentraland support to accommodate future SDK changes.** Currently whenever there is a significant Decentraland SDK update, the development team is required to manually update Byldr’s Decentraland logic convertor and scene exporter – or risk our Decentraland export service not working. To increase reliability, efficiency and decrease the requirement for manual updates, the Byldr team will implement automated backend SDK updates to prevent any breaking changes caused by Decentraland SDK updates from negatively affecting our export service.\n- **The ability to download the Decentraland scene source code for any Decentraland scenes created using Byldr, to provide creators with additional flexibility and ownership over their parcel’s content.** Another common request is for the ability of creators to download the TypeScript and full source code of their Decentraland parcels from Byldr. This will empower creators to further tweak the TypeScript code or make any further customizations outside of Byldr and publish to Decentraland directly.","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Byldr team and our associated partners.\n\nThe team comprises:\n- Sean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n- Stephen Clarke (Management)\n- Ketan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n- Varun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n- Clint Campbell (XR developer)\n- Paul Gumpert (XR developer)\n- Clinton Reddie (XR developer)\n- [VeeRuby Technologies](https://www.veeruby.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n- [AppVolks LLC](https://www.appvolks.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n- [XR Dev Studio](https://www.xrdevstudio.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

Precisely that: people will be able to assign temporary rights for their NFTs to be used by other people who do not own the NFT.]\n\nInteresting is that not only delegations but also rentals will be allowed. A Small Fee will be distributed to the Decentraland DAO in the rental process.\n\nSo, every paid rent will become a new revenue for the entire DAO.\n\nThe % will be between 0.1-5% of the total amount paid to the renter.\n\n—---------\n\nWhy does native on-chain delegation matter?\nDecentraland’s roots are decentralized and fully on-chain.\nIn a decentralized, open and programmable database, such as a blockchain, it is essential to know if the one who interacts is the owner of the NFT or the User.\nOn-Chain delegation is like sharing; there is someone who owns the NFT, but they can share it with a friend or coworker, among others; thus reducing the barriers for new users.\nFinally, you can delegate an NFT through the back-end, but WakeUp Labs also provides a front-end to help users to delegate and rent more simply.\n\nThe Issue for Decentraland LAND holders:\nWith the boom and the hype of last year in Decentraland, lands were auctioned, and now if someone wants to join Decentraland by owning land, it isn't very easy.\nAlso, the virtual world is only as valuable as the experiences and content that may exist there. And with many lands for speculation, the possibilities of having new content and experiences in the metaverse are reduced.\nWe know that many lands are without any use; this causes the land supply to shrink and reduces the chance of more builders. What happens if someone holds more than one land plot but wants only to use one? What can they do with the rest of the plots?\nIf landowners want to keep lands simply because they're interested in the project or perhaps because they haven't yet assigned them a specific use, they wouldn't be generating new income or new users.\n\nWake Up solution:\nAllow Rent and On-Chain Delegation to Decentraland Lands through a simple interface.\nOnce the NFT has been delegated, the now \"delegate\" will be able to access all its benefits (for instance, holding an event or an art exhibition) but will not have the right to transfer it. The NFT will always be in the owner's wallet. \nLenders cannot only list a Decentraland land in a rental marketplace but also generate a magical link for a particular renter. Also, they can delegate it to a friend for free. \n\nThis NFT delegation mechanism will open a whole new world of opportunities/functionalities for NFT projects and holders.","specification":"There are some important features to mention:\n\n-The NFT never leaves the owner's wallet, → reduces the risk of losing an NFT.\n\n-The NFT owner can decide to whom they will assign the delegation.\n\n-It all occurs on-chain, in a trustless and decentralized way (no need for extra intermediaries nor centralized systems)\n\n-A fee % goes to the Decentraland DAO.\n\nIt's just the beginning; this could be the first feature to implement with Decentraland. Delegable Wearables could be the next. These delegable/rentable wearables could allow owners and users to go to a special place uniquely for them\n\nTo make this happen, from WakeUp Labs, we will create the necessary smart contracts and APIs for the proper Decentraland integration to our platform and enable NFT delegation/renting for Decentraland LANDs.\n\nAfter this stage, our next move is to create a permissionless rental dapp, so Decentraland (and any other project) can easily add these new revenue streams (earning royalties fees every time an NFT is rented).","personnel":"Founders Team:\nMilton Berman is an Informatics Engineer graduate.

Knowing this, MetaTrekkers wants to become the platform that brings the artist and metaverse-user communities together and rewards them for their participation in various series of entertainment events, sessions and talks.\nThe grant would cover the development, marketing and advertising of the events and innovative features aimed at improving the Decentraland user experience.\nBy expanding the brand awareness of Decentraland as a user engagement-focused metaverse, we are reaching out to new users interested in onboarding and attracting a new, important target – brands looking to adopt new “customer journey” technologies and solutions.\nTurning art and entertainment series like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music Concerts or the BeatTrekkers DJ Battles into Decentraland resident events, we are ensuring a constant flow of metaverse newcomers originating from the artists’ fanbase. As a fresh experience for a new user, we want to offer a full range of engaging performances and means for them to showcase their art, all while being rewarded for their activity with metaverse-specific benefits provided by a large network of partner locations and projects spread all over Decentraland.\nEstablishing MetaTrekkers as an artist and entertainment platform, which constantly develops new concepts based on community involvement, will provide a ramp for Decentraland to multiply its reach and an incentive for artists and fans alike to discover the endless possibilities featured in a socially active, virtual environment. The possibility for the Decentraland DAO and the platform to become a hub for visionary artists who want to explore the virtual environment and experiment together with their following, relies on investing in the proper partnership and communication opportunities, like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music collaboration and the development of a Decentraland onboarding standard, which will be made available to all Decentraland venues through an open-source kit.\nThe funds from the DAO grant will serve to build the platform as a self-sustainable project that represents a portal for artists and fans across the planet, and from other metaverses, to access Decentraland and make it the go-to virtual world for entertainment and arts.","specification":"To paint a clear picture of the importance held by the MetaTrekkers events regarding onboarding new users into Decentraland and building an organic community, we must start from the beginning of our metaverse entertainment journey.\n\nDubfest\nOur first step into the (big) live events territory was when the MetaTrekkers Clubhouse hosted the 24 hour / 24 artists Dub Fest, the first event of its kind in the metaverse, which brought over 300 visitors to the Decentraland location, out of which we succeeded to convert into Decentraland regular users around 80%.\n\nVenice Music\nThe MetaTrekkers entertainment journey continued with a partnership that emphasizes the overall importance our initiative holds in regard to making the Decentraland metaverse known and accessible to new target audiences. We are talking about the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music series of concerts. It is worth mentioning that this music label was founded by Troy Carter, former manager for artists like Eve, John Legend and Lady Gaga, and one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to direct their business towards web3, through an NFT-gated, professional collective.\n\nThe first concert of the series also brought a strategic collaboration for MetaTrekkers – teaming up with Decentral Games in order to offer the best onboarding experience for all the fans who wanted to attend their favorite artist’s concert but were new to the metaverse. To put it into numbers, the first MetaTrekkers x Venice Music concert has given us the opportunity to reach a new audience of 2.5 million social media accounts (all four artists’ following combined).\n\nYossy Concert\nThe next milestone of our Decentraland entertainment adventure was an important event for the Latinx NFT music scene, and it was marked by a special concert featuring Yossy, a Latinx musician and first-time metaverse performer. This event has allowed us to reach a new, niche audience of over 12k followers, of which some became Decentraland users after receiving their metaverse onboarding.\n\nBeatTrekkers\nCurrently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it engages twelve competing artists, guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences – the participating artists’ metaverse-newbie fans and general public interested in the benefits associated with NFT music and being part of a developing metaverse community.\n\nSince our aim is to give back to the community as much we can, one of the main rewarding ideas within BeatTrekkers is to give fans and supporters access to the artists’ work, well beyond the live performances, in the form of wearables, NFTs and private lessons led by the artists themselves. The BeatTrekkers series has the potential to become a platform for Decentraland to onboard big names in the music industry. \n\nIn order to make this happen, we are requesting a grant of $120,000 USD. This funding will be used to cover the costs of marketing, event production and artist fees. We believe that this grant will pay off in the form of increased awareness and adoption of Decentraland, as well as providing a fun and immersive experience for art and music fans.

The city was designed to serve as a spot where visitors are incentived to attend events in order to generate traffic. Sponsors pay to host events, attendees earn a reward for attending them which generates traffic, and this traffic then draws interest from other brands looking for exposure. Brands can also establish a more permanent residence by leasing space within the city. Spaces include art galleries, NFT storefronts, brand headquarters, games, and more.\n\nWith this grant, we are proposing:\n\n1. Completion of a racing game where players race each other around a track. We have already built a track that runs around the perimeter of the Chicago area in the city, and we already have the ability to change avatars into Battle Racers vehicles. Next steps that this grant will help us achieve is turning all of this into a game with free/paid races, prize distribution, leaderboard, additional vehicle choices, and choice of environment. Vehicle choices will include DCL skins as well as integration of external NFT projects (such as we have already done with the TKING Bugatti). Environment choices could include ideas like UFO crash site, apocalypse, or seasonal decor.\n\n2. Turning the Mehak Jain Gallery chessboard collaboration into a playable game. Users will have the choice to play for free, or to compete for prizes in exchange for a gameplay fee. A leaderboard will keep track of player's win/loss ratio. Players enjoy a more immersive Alice in Wonderland kind of experience from controlling their pieces from inside the game rather than looking top down at the board.\n\n3. Comedy club venue which will host playlists of pre-recorded sets as well as live-streamed shows. We are hosting playlist content already for our partners at Comedy Hub, but it is located in the stadium alongside music playlists. The grant money will go toward a dedicated space for comedy shared by multiple partners - bringing the best all in one place. Content will be updated regularly so that audiences have fresh selection to choose from in order to encourage repeat visits. The club will be decorated with humorous atmosphere and a classy vibe that is friendly for all ages. Comedy sets will be clearly marked and categorized by level of vulgarity/maturity so that users can filter for the type of comedy that suits their personal preference.\n\n4. Escape room where players must work together to solve a mystery in order to find their way out of a precarious situation. The theme of this build will be a Cursed Egyptian Tomb. But it'll be built in such a way that we will be able to replicate important parts of it for other themes as well in the future. Abandoned Spaceship Mission? Murder Mystery Mansion? Jungle Temple? The possibilities are endless.\n\nEach of these will be built on 2x2 estates already available within the city.","specification":"Racing game - 2x2 multilevel racetrack. Up to 4 racers per track. Racers choose between different environments to race around. The track remains the same for each environment. Users can also choose their vehicle. There will be 5-10 Battle Racers vehicles to choose from by default. We will also integrate DCL avatar skins to increase vehicle selection even further which can include animals, mythical creatures, planes, spaceships, or anything else that the community comes up with. Vehicle speed will remain the same regardless of the type. A leaderboard will record fastest race times. All races must finish by a certain time (5 minutes?). Users cannot go backward, only forward, in order to prevent shortcuts to the finish line. Falling off the track results in starting at the beginning again. Racers will need to balance risk of falling off while going too fast, versus going slow and staying on the track but then risk getting passed up by other racers. Gameplays will be free and paid. Winners of free gameplays receive no prize. Winners of paid gameplays receive a large share of the gameplay fees, and second place earns their gameplay fee back.\n\nChess game - 2x2 chessboard. Players control their pieces from inside the game. Hovering over a piece highlights the squares that the piece is able to be moved to, and then the destination square becomes clickable. Upon choosing the destination square, the piece then follows a path to it. If an enemy piece is already present on the same square, it is removed from the game. Captured enemy pieces from each team are tracked in the UI. Players may compete for free, or pay a gameplay fee. Winners of paid games will receive their gameplay fee back as well as a portion of the other player’s gameplay fee. Top ranked players will be shown on a leaderboard.\n\nComedy club - 2x2 venue. A shared club for multiple comedians and comedy groups. Each will have their own playlist for videos that will be shown on a screen (similar to the music playlists in the stadium). The club will have dedicated space for different comedic content. For example, family-friendly content will be separate from adult content. We will live stream sets as well to bring audiences together in a more social format for enjoying comedy. Amateur nights will give lesser known comedians some spotlight. Comedians that contribute content will be allowed to advertise their upcoming events and link out to their social media accounts.\n\nEscape room - 2x2 environment. A collaborative experience where players work together to solve a mystery in order to escape the scene alive within a certain timeframe (30 minutes?). An archaeologist has gone missing and the team needs to figure out what happened, and then escape before suffering the same ill fate. A journal is found with some clues. It contains deciphered hieroglyphics with captions like “curse”, “sickness”, “death” which look similar to some of those inscribed on the tomb walls. Some of the pages also contain rough sketches of artifacts and a partial map. A raspy voice on a recording seem to indicate some instructions on what to do with these materials. There will be a gameplay fee but no rewards for successful escapes. Parts of the game may be randomized in order to curb cheating, but unlike a P2E game, the goal for this one is to create a fun experience that encourages players to bring back more family/friends to share it with regardless of the outcome of their game.","personnel":"Doug (Doug | NFTWorld.io#0519 on Discord) has been an OG contributor within Decentraland since the beginning. In 2019 he founded NFT World (https://nftworld.io/) to promote brands in the Metaverse. Since then, Doug and team have created various DCL scenes that now comprise NFT World City and have also built:\n\nMetaverse Chat (https://metaversechat.io/) - Incorporates Decentraland avatar profiles into a blockchain-based chat app.\nMetaverse Browser Extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metaverse/nghkdhckeabmkjbklgocfoojnpchhlgc) - Makes it easier to navigate resources for Decentraland and other virtual worlds in the Metaverse.\nMetaverse Coin (https://mtvrs.com/) - Handed out at NFT World City events to incentive attendance.\nMTVRS Market (https://market.mtvrs.com/) - Offers utility for Metaverse Coin by allowing holders to exchange the coin for NFT World avatar wearables which can then be sold for other currency on the Decentraland Marketplace or OpenSea.\n\nThe team consists of freelancers sourced from platforms like Upwork as well as some of the best known experts from within the Decentraland community. We have talent that covers all of the required key skill areas for building within Decentraland - developers, 3D modelers, graphic designers, etc. Which specific individuals will assist with each project associated with this proposal will be determined once it passes, but the core team will include trusted partners that we have already worked with in the past.","roadmap":"The order of priority is:\n\n1. Racing game (1 month)\n2. Chess game (1 month)\n3. Comedy Club (1 month)\n4. Escape room (3 months)\n\nThe racing game will be top priority out of the gate. Since we already have a head start on it, as well as the chess game, the team may at times work on different projects simultaneously in order to avoid bottlenecks. For example, 3D modelers might begin building out the comedy club venue and escape room environment while devs code the nuts and bolts of the racing and chess games that already have some of the visual foundation built. We will converge when possible in order to focus all efforts on completing one deliverable from the list at a time in a top-down manner. \n\nIn terms of ETA's, we will deliver all projects within a 6 month timeframe. We expect the escape room to take the longest since it is the most complex build, and will be built from scratch, so we estimate 3 months for it.

Since the beginning of our previous grant, we have not sold ANY in-game content within Decentraland.\n\nThe funding requested would allow us to continue to scale to achieve the ambitious goals detailed in the Beta 1.0 section of our roadmap below. Now that we have completed our first closed “gameplay loops” and base mechanics, we are ready to deliver on-chain paid content, P2P monetization and link it all to our tokenomics. These features would create sustainability for the project.\n\nJump into our District Plaza at [76,51]. Claim free Mons to get started. Check out the Player House at [79, 46].

We launched the Alpha 1.0 version between April 2021 and March 2022. We launched the Alpha 2.0 version between March 2022 and now (very much thanks to our previous grant). \n\nBelow are some of the key milestones achieved in Alpha 2.0 (post-grant):\n\nAlpha 2.0\n\nThe Alpha 2.0 version of Ethermon in DCL expanded on Alpha 1.0’s base by adding optimization, social aspects, earning potential & progression.\n\nIn addition to the highlights below, we also pushed many balancing adjustments, bug fixes & code improvements.\n\n1) Major District Optimizations - we completely reworked our code, assets & load strategies to make the experience smoother for our players.\n\n2) WebSocketServer - We added WSS not only so that our many scenes can work together seamlessly (having your Mon follow you across scene boundaries, keep real time stats when switching scenes, etc.), but also so that you can see other player's Mons! WSS is something we will continually update as we add more and more social experiences, and the game naturally transitions from single player -> multiplayer.\n\n3) Weekly P2E Leaderboard Events - each week we have been hosting a weekly leaderboard event where our users defeat enemies in turn based/skill-based battles and earn points based on enemies defeated.\n\n4) Added 117 New Mons - Our goal is to add every single Ethermon into DCL - fully modeled/animated, with custom move sets, probabilities, skill points, etc. We are constantly adding more and more (there are 300+), but since the time of our last proposal we have added 117 new ones!\n\n5) Complete UI Upgrade - We have upgraded all of our UI. Load times are smoother and the HUDs are much more optimized. Some examples of upgrades include HUDs for: changing your Mon team, switching Mons within a team, backpack for loot, storage for excess loot, switching battle moves on a Mon, seeing real time point stats (individual), seeing real time point stats (leaderboard), burning loot for essence & also crafting.\n\n6) Crafting – This was Part 1 of our biggest update yet. All of the loot you collect from battling can be used to craft “Equipment”. Each equipment has its own crafting recipes and unique benefits. With 8 different “types” of equipment, you can attach them to your Mons to receive stats boosts and custom buffs. In addition, you can craft items, that when combined, allow you spawn 1 of 6 different bosses. See below.\n\n7) Bosses – This was Part 2 of our biggest update yet. In Biome 1 (first battle area in the district) there are 6 different bosses that can be spawned, each with custom stats, elements, move sets, loot and models/textures. Bosses drop extremely rare equipment and are difficult to defeat. They have been built in a way that allows us to quickly and easily deliver bosses for each of the subsequent Biomes, which will create a natural progression for the players. \n\n8) Biome 2 – All of the models, textures, enemies and loot have already been completed. We are ready to push, but were waiting to release updates 6 & 7 above, which we just pushed at the end of August.\n\n9) Consumable Items – Similarly, consumable items have been developed and are ready for release in the crafting menus and our soon to be “item shops”.","personnel":"Core Team\n\nOur core team includes game design, metaverse, and blockchain industry experts.\n\n•\tEric (EB), Co-Founder and 3D Lead\n•\tIdon, Co-Founder and Blockchain Tech Lead\n•\tJamie, COO\n•\tNycolas, Lead Game Designer & Front-End Developer\n•\tInihility, Senior Full Stack Developer\n•\tJuxton, Front-End Developer\n•\tMohib (Mariana44), Back-End Developer/Smart Contract Developer\n•\tKhushal, Full-Stack Developer\n•\tHetal, Junior Front-End Developer\n•\tPolygonal Minds (Lau and Hugo), 3D Artists\n•\tArpesh, 3D Artist\n•\tJavid, 2D Artist","roadmap":"Q4 2022 / Q1 2023 — Beta 1.0\n\nWe are ready to move towards the Beta version of development, which will truly make the game play-to-earn, social & expansive, as well as create monetizable gameplay for serious players, casual players, F2P players, guilds & collectors/whales alike.\n\nOur first versions of the game created a base layer and a closed gameplay loop. Along with further optimizations, balance changes, more Mons & expandable progression, our goal is now to add content that will make the game sustainable, as well as create an economy for all types of players.\n\nMilestone Goals:\n\nGuilds - create a guild, recruit members, upgrade a sharable guild \"house\", compete against other guilds\n\nQuests - both for individuals and for groups. Complete guild \"quests\" to unlock content & speed up progression\n\nMultiplayer PvE and PvP - fight enemies & bosses together as a guild.

Guests can not only watch the wedding from the outside but also participate in various quests.\nTo celebrate a traditional wedding, all the necessary locations must be booked in advance.

And a virtual wedding can be arranged in no time due to the special mechanics that will be installed at the San Fransisco City Hall location.","specification":"San Fransisco City Hall will not be just a beautiful wedding place. Guests and a newlywed couple will be integrated into the process. \nThe main object of the location is the building in romantic colors: pink and white. Entering the main entrance, users will see the altar, NPC-priest, and the guests' area. On the right side, the screen, the dancing platform, and the DJ controller will be installed. On the left side, the users will find the photo zone, the buffet, and the gift zone. The second floor is filled with the technical rooms of the wedding palace.\nWe want to make the process of marriage as interesting as possible. One of the key roles in the wedding is dedicated to the NPC priest. All the lines of the dialogue will be translated to the special screen, so the guests will be able to see the dialogue. The gameplay will be addictive - the newlywed couple should find the hidden heart logos and bring them to the NPC priest to get to the second part of the ceremony. While collecting the coins, a big red heart will fill up with colors. When all logos are collected, the couple will be able to exchange the rings and finally receive an NFT certificate of digital marriage. The NFT will be generated automatically and will include the avatars’ photos, their names, and the date of the wedding ceremony. The NFT will also be seen to all the guests in the form of a pop-up banner. \nAt the end of the ceremony, the avatars will be able to fire a salute from the cannons installed outside of the building.","personnel":"Maff Metaverse has 2,5 years of working experience with the metaverses. We are building a strong community interested in digital reality whose aim is to popularize and develop metaverses. Our team consists of creators - both designers and developers - that we attract through online hackathons that we host. More than 60 creators participated in our first hackathon that was dedicated to building in Decentraland. Subsequently, the Maff Metaverse art park was created. It consists of the best 9 objects that were developed during the hackathon by our creators. What’s more, public areas like a flying space platform and stage were added to create the atmosphere of a festival.\n\nAs developers, we constantly improve our skills, always exploring the abilities of metaverses and implementing ideas that no one has ever done before. For example, on New year’s eve, we tested the phygital approach - connecting lights on the real Christmas tree with the one located in Decentraland. Our creators’ community attended the event in the metaverse and could change the color of the real physical tree by changing the lights in Decentraland.\nMaff Metaverse also has an experience in game development. We created a turtle parkour quest.  Those who made it to the last turtle received an NFT gift.\nWe also conducted a few projects: a party on a yacht, a showroom for a clothes brand, and a wedding.

The event will have live Djs (both in real live and in the metaverse),  live street art/VR performance from renowned Colombian artists such as Ceroker https://www.instagram.com/ceroker/, Tres Manos Studio  https://www.instagram.com/atresmanosestudio/, and the launch of a wearable collection by Kaftan https://kaftan.com.co/. \n\n**The Espacio Creador is conceived as a space for co-creation and promotion of creative disciplines**, covering the areas of design, technology, fashion, plastic- , visual- , sound- , interactive arts and new media.\n\nIt aims to **enable environments where these areas converge, allowing experimentation and creation**. These environments will be focused on strengthening the culture and art of developing cultures as well as their recognition both locally and internationally. In addition to this, **Espacio Creador aims to strengthen the art industry through the creation of innovative diffusion channels which allow new ways to perceive and consume culture.** \n\nTo this end, the creative space offers a series of environments and channels, both digital and physical, which together form an ecosystem of extended interaction, with the intention of covering a wide range of artistic intentions.

The experience aims to prioritise the exhibition spaces by using large rooms that are interconnected by floating corridors, offering the visitor a dynamic tour through the building\n\n**Architecture**\n\n- The architectural style for the creative space is inspired in minimalist futurism with large geometrically oriented spaces, viewpoints and external corridors with a dynamic character.\n\n- Given the technical limitations and the planned aesthetic for the experience, we will develop orthogonal geometric forms with bevels, and a high presence of diagonals that dynamize the forms without overloading the mesh with polygons.\n\n- We will build large halls that highlight the work exhibited in conjunction with the architecture. These halls will be connected by open-air elevated corridors with platforms, floating walls  and terraces with a minimalist futuristic touch.\n\n- We seek to experiment with sculptural ornaments embedded in the architecture that give a certain personification to the space, and that end up constituting a differentiating style with other spaces in Decentraland.\n\n\n**Exhibition Spaces**\n\n- 16:9 Rooms - 16:9 aspect ratio rooms that allow the best possible portrayal of works of this size.\n\n- Floating Walls - Walls that are not connected to the rest of the building in any way, and that show exhibition screens or sculptures in ways that would be impossible in reality.\n\n- Transparent Ceilings and Floors - In some rooms we will look for works to be displayed on the ceiling and on second floor layers that can be observed from a specific viewing angle.\n\n- Large screens - The aim is to introduce large screens with animated or video content to create an object that can be appreciated for a long time. \n\n**Tour**\n\nThe primary goal of the tour is to offer the visitor an experience of non-linear prolonged interest, that can be explored in different ways and which captures the attention of the observer due to its dynamic character. This tour will take the visitor through rooms of different dimensions and distributions, through long corridors and surfaces with characteristics similar to those of platform games, which force the user to jump, eventually fail and have to try again.\nFinally, we will offer easy exit access, such as open windows or possibilities of falling into floating corridors, which do not force the visitor to return to the entrance to leave the building at the moment he/she wishes to do so.\n\n\n***Use of Funds***\n\n\n**The grant will be used to pay part of the development costs of Espacio Creador hub in  LAND [\"-61,45\",\"-61,46\",\"-62,45\"]** in accordance with the previous requirements and **prepare multiple activation event for Espacio Creador both in the virtual and in the real world**.

We have created a method for streamlined production and also will release a process for others to submit videos/courses to the Library. While the course material is currently focused on DCL, we plan to accept all kinds of courses in the future to include other material.\n\n**Needs / goals that will be satisfied:**\n\n• Decentraland is growing rapidly and every experience has different components and requirements to participate (tokens used, social medias to engage with, event schedules, game mechanics, etc.). For example:\n\n     o DG has multiple currencies on multiple chains and participating in $ICE Poker requires specific wearables, staking, activations, delegation and more\n\n     o The Decentraland Report uses Xpand as their social media platform, has tokenized music NFTs, $REPORT tokens, and more\n\n     o This results in a high barrier to entry for most individuals as it requires learning about completely new concepts and items for every experience they want to participate in\n\n• Developing high-quality onboarding videos is very time consuming and often takes a backseat to the continued development work of DCL experiences\n\n**This grant will fund:** \n\n• The creation of educational onboarding videos for groups across Decentraland\n\n• Creation of gamified educational experiences in the CurationStation with future plans for gamification across Decentraland that encourage users to learn and explore what DCL has to offer\n\n• And will foster growth within DCL communities by breaking down complex ecosystems in easily digestible ways to onboard users\n \n**Description of feature / content:**\n\n• The current Library floor plan will be expanded and include new functionality (e.g. moveable ladders, integrated virtual courses, NPCs, item spawn points, and games) \n\n• Talking to the Librarian, users can complete an initial quest to receive a Library Card which gives users access to an introductory set of courses\n\n• Users can then complete additional quests to receive Library Credits and access additional virtual courses \n\n• Initially, courses (~1-5min) will be created by DCL Curations in partnership with the organization that the course covers – at no cost to the organization – and includes:\n\n     o Script development and review with group\n\n     o Audio recording\n\n     o Visual recording\n\n     o Video editing\n\n     o Final review and edits\n\n     o Course upload / Hosting in Library\n\n• Later, courses will also be able to be submitted to the team for review to ensure content accuracy. Accepted courses will be integrated in the Virtual Library & the creators will receive a cash reward from the Grant Course Creation Budget (payment amount TBD)\n\n**Skills / experience that will contribute to success:**\n\n• We have a team of top DCL Advisors and developers with design, modeling, SDK, and backend architecture skills that are working together to deliver a seamless experience to the DCL community\n\n• We have created a 10-part educational series for Decentral Games which is representative of the courses we will be creating for other DCL groups\n\n• Our current understanding of the inter-workings of many prominent groups in DCL allows for quicker development / review of video scripts\n\n\n**Links**\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DCLCurations\n\nLinkedIn:

We also created the scenery and over 100 assets for use in the game.\n\nThe Beta of Exodus went live on June 20th, 2022 at coordinates 126,44. In the 12 weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Woodchopping, Scavenger Hunting, Fishing, and now Mining. Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Forging, Workshopping, and Hunting. During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.\n\nWe plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion.

We’re offering to provide this experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nOur aim in the future is that IK will evolve into a platform where community members can submit and QA puzzle modules as templates, and then projects can use those templates to host engaging quests for their own content. Like decentralized Roblox for casual puzzle games using Web3 composability and treasure.\n\nFor now, we are working with existing Web3 projects to provide extended engagement for existing content to help fill up space in the metaverse with more and more content as users onboard. While we build these experiences we are continuing to grow our available features for hunts, challenges, and puzzles to help projects give their users actually engaging games instead of surface-level contests and impression-based promotions.","specification":"The IK Team will design and implement a “Pack” of three challenges across projects in Decentraland. For a simple example of a Pack, please play with the IK Starter Pack: [https://www.infinitykeys.io/pack/starter-pack](https://www.infinitykeys.io/pack/starter-pack). Each requirement has its own challenge (which can be multi-step), and players must solve a simple riddle, solve an anagram using the IK Thesis, and find IK values in our Discord channel. \n\nFor the Decentraland Pack, we will create multi-step challenges inside Decentraland, such as locate object hunts on particular plots, hidden ciphers and passcodes, riddles based on text or lore, claiming in-world items, or signing guestbooks on particular plots. \n\nThe IK team will monitor relevant Decentraland Discord channels and maintain a dedicated Decentraland channel on our own server. \n\nThe IK team will launch social and signage assets in coordination with Decentraland and relevant project accounts to alert users that there are challenges and games to play. \n\nAt the conclusion of each challenge, players will be able to claim a free NFT on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, or Avalanche C-chain. These are Infinity Keys 1155 NFTs that feature different concepts, from themed art to ancient maps. \n\nWhile these NFTs are collectible by nature, collecting them can also be used as requirements for future Decentraland (or other) hunts.\n\nAfter claiming all three challenge NFTs, players are able to claim an overarching Pack Achievement. Players that claim this achievement will have demonstrated significant engagement across Decentraland and will be eligible for a randomly selected drawing for $500 in MANA to be selected and distributed at some predetermined end date. This step is optional.\n\nThe hunts and NFTs will remain available for play as long as the associated projects and lore remains available to keep the puzzle logic intact (e.g. if one of the partners changes their plot and removes the location of a passcode, the game will not function and either need to be revised or removed), but the incentive for a campaign-focused drawing will end at the predetermined date.\n\nHow it benefits the DCL Creator Community:\n\n- Infinity Keys provides a place for DCL visitors to participate in treasure hunts, fostering a stronger sense of community and engagement through providing content and puzzles that engage curiosity and satisfaction.\n- Decentraland community will collect NFTs, and be entered in a drawing for MANA, funded by this grant.\n- Infinity Keys will continue building experiences for Decentraland, we will add functionality based on community feedbacks and ideas.\n- Strengthen community ties and foster a stronger sense of belonging to Decentraland by creating hunts that allow people to collaborate together with friends and strangers to solve problems.\n\nThe budget for this proposal is $5000. The typical B2B price for this level of a designed 4-challenge package is $4,599. We have reduced that price in order to make $500 in MANA available as a player giveaway incentive. There are more substantial packages available in a subscription-type model, but we anticipate running this initial campaign as a pilot before approaching Decentraland DAO for recurring funding.","personnel":"Infinity Keys is a small team currently developing puzzles, infrastructure, an initial B2B model, and a small community of puzzle builders. We are in the midst of an angel funding round and will conduct additional fundraising to scale and turn the B2B model into a community-facing platform in the future. This proposal would effectively treat Decentraland as an entry-tier B2B client. We anticipate running this as a pilot with the ability to create many more nested and expansive hunts across Decentraland in the future.\n\n[Andy Boyan, Ph.D., Co-Founder](https://twitter.com/andyboyan)\n\nGage Mondok, Technical Co-Founder, (Twitter anon)\n\n[Elizabeth Barnes](https://twitter.com/ebethbarnes)\n\n[Aaron Bendersky](https://github.com/chair28980)\n\n[Hamilton Evans](https://github.com/ham-evans)\n\n[Tawnee Allport](https://github.com/stormcloud266), Front-end developer\n\n[Kori B.

With minimal learning curve, farmers found a reason to log in daily and continue harvesting their crops, making it a daily, social affair for DCL players. Furthermore, BPF continues to host events monthly, rewarding farmers for participating and ascending the leaderboard.\n\nInitially started as a pet project by a single developer, the team quickly expanded into a team of 5 due to high traction and interest from the community. As we progressively improved the game features and mechanics, it requires dedication from the team to ideate and solve complex and challenging problems. The team extensively did pro-bono work for all wearables, events, development, server cost, 3D modelling and design efforts. Therefore, we seek funding from the community, as it would be difficult to continue self-funding and dedicating ourselves to BPF, without the necessary support we hoped for in our expansion plan.

Overall gameplay and server improvements. Server redundancy, improvements and database backup. Airdrops are scheduled and latency is lowered. User Interface (UI) revamp to improve the overall outlook of the farm. Improvement to facilitate better User Experience (UX). To do this, we design and develop UI while incorporating Design Innovation techniques to improve the overall gameplay. While the team improves the gameplay, we are actively looking to improve the shop functions, UI and UX as well. Farmers will be surprised with a new shop interface that improves their overall experience.\n \n2. New plants and plant drops. With the development of new plants, farmers can plant different plants to gain in-game currency (BPF coins) and exchange for wearables. Farmers can also look forward to receiving in-game materials from the plants in the near future!\n \n3. Crafting. With the development of the crafting feature, farmers can expect to combine in-game materials and currency to get wearables and unique in-game items. These wearables and items could provide specific bonuses to events and plants!\n \n4. New Animals. After achieving funds, our designer and developers will work in tandem to design and develop unique animals for players to enjoy and catch. Farmers can anticipate new animals they have never seen before!\n \n5. New wearables. These wearables give bonuses in-game, which encourages farmers to farm and acquire them. As we would engage designers, farmers can look forward to wearables of different styles, collections and appearances. Through our funding, we intend to launch multiple wearables every month to boost farmers' experience, goals and gameplay in BPF.\n \n6. Monthly events and rewards. Apart from the main objective of P2E, our team aims to give back and engage the community regularly by providing a different avenue to participate in the farm. Monthly events will be unique and farmers can experience different gameplay to enhance their experience. Examples are the ‘Climb the Beanstalk’ event to reach the floating cloud platform and ‘Chasing the Animal’ event with a Magic Flute summoning many animals at once! Rewards are given to hardworking farmers who reached the top of the leaderboards. Farmers can purchase wearables in-game (via in-game currency or MANA) when they participate in such events to gain specific boosts to their stats! These events are proprietary ideas that the team had conceptualized to make BPF a more enjoyable game for everyone.\n \n7. Development of Cloud.

Letting preconceived ideas about why web3 is bad block their ability to utilize these technologies, people that could benefit from them the most do not. One example is artists. Without having somebody to talk with artists about the technology and facilitate them embracing this technology, artists are not able to be benefitted from it. \nFor many artists, creating new NFTs, as well as attracting and maintaining communities that believe in their project is an issue. In Christchurch, New Zealand there is a community of artists (tied to a physical location XCHC) creating a movement in real life through creative events and facilitating spaces in a way that enables community and culture to thrive. However, this community has only started to embrace web3. As a fairly young and small country, the culture has room to improve with their standard of entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. This ultimately leaves many dissatisfied, feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is especially known for being largely consertive, “closing early”, clique art world, and most “music venues' ' are just bars profiteering off music, leaving most alternative/original music overlooked. Though the XCHC  has been doing great work with artists for 7+ years, this community remains a bit hidden from the wider world (as we’re sure most alternative/independant art spaces can relate). Artists here remain disconnected from the global reach and possibilities enabled by embracing web3 technology, such as NFTs, tokens, and DAOs. However, some are ready to take the next step. \nOnce people embrace web3, initially it’s often for personal gain and not for public good. Without utilizing this technology for public good, people are unable to see the huge benefits for the world that can come from web3. By embracing web3 through an artistic community and ensuring that the community is guided by doing public good, we can create a more positive narrative than is currently portrayed in many media outlets.","specification":"These funds will be used as a stepping stone to make New Zealand a global destination for creatives pushing the edges of culture and creative experiences in a way that harmonizes with the whenua (land) and a more sustainable future. Along with that, it will be used to onboard artists into web3 and create a documented onboarding process. As appropriate, existing DAO management tools will be incorporated into this process. When gaps in tooling are discovered, these components will be highlighted and the need expressed to create these tools. For the next Mary Hush and other in real life events, we expect to channel some of this funding to them to facilitate them stepping into new realms of creativity. In order to do this the core team needs to be compensated for the active 'on the ground' development, enabling others to expand into the digital space. Along with that the expansion of the advisory team and formalizing the process towards decentralization will be done. A large portion of the funding will go towards enabling a large number of artists to step into the web3 space and to get a large number of original works from across New Zealand. The XCHC will open a content creators studio to serve 2 purposes: Report and record the progress our members are making into the web3 space and to inspire others to join our community.

You examine its exterior and notice a gold-tinged seal with a coin-shaped sigil embossed into it. Suddenly, the seal springs open and grains of sand fly out in a flurry around you. Moments later, after you’ve regained your senses, you realize that you’re in a completely new area of the world – somewhere massive, surreal, sandy, and bustling with life.\n\n“Welcome, human, to the marketplace,” a peculiar voice calls from an alley behind you, “I see you received my letter. Come, this way...” they say as their wrinkly, bejeweled finger beckons you to follow.\n\n**Description**\n\nFull doc -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10gLDguQpjONSHXQZe6_aO9DopUoWXMC3e4Jp4xzYAi8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe marketplace at its core will address three common-sense problems that have yet to be implemented into the Decentraland experience: trying on and purchasing Marketplace items as a User, showcasing created items to sell in Storefronts as a Creator, and participating in the DAO as a Voter. The Decentraland Foundation is hard at work on many areas for the platform, so it’s time the community steps up to help build out this much-desired in-game functionality.\n\nThe DCL platform has been around since 2018, yet we still purchase in-game items (clothing, land, names, nfts) and vote for change through our browsers rather than inside the world of Decentraland. The marketplace aims to provide an improved experience to users by offering a free way to purchase and sell items in-game without ever having to leave the game world or pull up a second window.\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has put a lot of effort into creating such an amazing platform for us all to meet, create, and explore. However, they must also rely on the community for innovation given the scale of the world. Our proposal aims to take some burden off the Foundation by building out these in-game purchasing experiences while also building amazing immersive content for the entire community. Being transparent, yes, it is already possible to sell wearables on your land in Decentraland. However, doing so remains a technical feat for most that requires an advanced skill set as well as land to deploy to. Doing so also lacks cohesion across a broader Marketplace vision that the marketplace seeks to accomplish through its initial Phase I deliverables.\n\nIn addition to the core functionality of the marketplace, our proposal touches on two gamification points: content creation and user retention. Through quests, storylines, factions, level progression, secret unveilings, in-game rewards, event spaces, and additional core activations such as future minigame(s), the marketplace will provide Decentraland users with engaging content that continues to evolve in complexity over time.\n\nThe marketplace is proposed to be 20x20 parcels (400 total) in size, which is the same scale as Genesis Plaza — that’s 1,102,223 square feet, 25.3 acres, or just over 19 football fields. The proposed location of the marketplace will be one of the two existing duplicate Plazas within Decentraland. Having a duplicate plaza is a redundant use of 400 parcels and there is currently no dedicated team at the Foundation to support the ongoing development of Genesis Plaza or its periphery.\n\nThis proposal, along with our proven team of dedicated creators, plan to transform this duplicate plaza into the marketplace vision laid before you.","specification":"**Phase 1 Deliverables**\n\n**The Oasis Central Hub**\n\nThe Oasis Central Hub, currently dubbed simply the Hub or Oasis, will be the primary entrypoint for anyone teleporting to the marketplace and is located at the absolute center of the plaza. It will be the largest piece of open air architecture and will act as the center for all marketplace-related content. Think of main online areas from Ralph Breaks the Internet and Ready Player One, or perhaps even RuneScape’s Grand Exchange for reference:\n\nAside from being a social center, the Hub will provide multiple “Info Desks” where Users will be able to obtain area information, see new item releases, and virtually search for wearables to discover, try on, and purchase from the Marketplace. Another part of the Hub will be the “Quest Desk” which will be touched on later. There will also be open gathering spaces for players to hang out, socialize, discuss trades/quests/etc. Additional planned interactivity includes various NPCs, custom signage, possible ‘secret’ quests, and a live visual $MANA feed to name a few.\n\n**The Marketplace Fields & Storefronts**\n\nThe marketplace fields will be organized into 4 quadrants around the Oasis Hub that will be populated with virtual Storefronts for all Creators. At the time of initial launch, 2 of the fields will be publicly open with the other 2 fields reserved for future expansion. Storefronts will initially focus on displaying primary sale products, but we plan to support secondary sale displays at a later date.\n\nEach field is huge – think of a massive flea market that looks like Dune meets Star Wars, or the RPO Columbus Stacks meets a Middle Eastern Marketplace type-of-feel). Each marketplace Field will have a unique look and feel while still blending with the surrounding context of the plaza. Here is our current reference imagery for the field vision:\n\nStorefronts will be free. To be eligible for a Storefront, the associated Creator wallet address must have at least one creation published on the Marketplace for a minimum of 30 days, however this logic is subject to change based on community feedback. As more collections are introduced, more Storefronts will be dynamically added to the ever-expanding Marketplace Fields stacks. Over time, this will create an evolving form of dynamic architecture. Here’s our initial proof of concept that is still in development with a lot of room for expansion:\n\nStorefronts will be modular in design and Marketplace Creators will have the ability to choose from various visual layouts and styles. Marketplace visitors will be able to walk between each Storefront to discover new creators, collections, and explore what else the Marketplace Fields will offer. Our current implementation for each Storefront takes advantage of openly-available data via The Graph to verify all Creator wallets.\n\n**Quests & Beyond**\n\nSpeaking of additional content, aside from the core goals of the Marketplace, we also have numerous immersive experiences planned that we believe will bring Users back again and again to streamline ongoing engagement and a sense of progress (similar to other P2E games in Decentraland, however, this will not be a P2E game). There will be reward and leveling systems to incentivize further engagement within the Marketplace that will go hand in hand with quests:\n\nFor Phase I, there are 4 public quests planned:\nPlease read the Google Doc for the full breakdown (can't fit it here!)","personnel":"Together, the Last Slice development team has successfully executed large-scale builds in collaboration with incredible AAA-brands such as Samsung, Playboy, and Snapple.

In addition, the majority of the new features require some external service to be built, to save outfits etc., which can be integrated faster and easier into the current backpack after they are built.","specification":"The project will consist of a single “front-end” web application, created using next.js, and a server application and database to store outfits and any user related content. Additionally, existing decentraland foundation services (lambdas + catalyst apis) are used to fetch avatar and wearable data.  \n\nThe services will most likely be hosted in AWS, but I will explore other options that can reduce costs so this can be hosted long term.  The final product will have any necessary production-ready features such as data security and encryption, potential use of CDN if loading times are an issue outside of the US, and potentially at least 2 server applications running for failover/redundancy if the need arises.\n\nThe first phase of the project will be focused on the main UI/UX features and the second phase includes integration with the catalyst endpoints to sync outfit changes in game.  In addition to the core features, I hope to add social features, such as seeing other people’s closets and being able to try on other’s saved outfits. \n\nThe goal is to increase user activity and socialization around wearable collections and stimulate more traffic to the marketplace by providing easy navigation for any items they are seeing.\n\nAfter completion, the project source code will be made public so everyone can benefit from the catalyst api avatar interactions, in an attempt to create an ecosystem of many clients, as well as examples of interacting with the dcl lambdas and nft apis.\n\nI have hosted an initial version to demonstrate feasibility, explore the data available and show the basic trying on features: [DCL Closet Prototype](https://dcl-closet.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)  \n\nTo use the app, paste in your wallet address under \"Avatar Address\" and your current avatar and backpack will load.  To preview your avatar with someone else's backpack, you can paste a different address into \"Backpack Address\"","personnel":"I am a full stack senior software engineer of over 10 years by profession and have all of the skills required to execute.

If you think about watching a video, sound is 50% of the experience (in my opinion it can be even up to 69% of the experience)! The same I think can be said for games and in interactive virtual world experiences (like Decentraland).\n\nI propose to create a series of sound clips that anyone building in Decentraland can use for absolutely free on their parcel (with a copyright notice/license agreement stating that these sound clips may only be used within Decentraland).\n\nMany games within Decentraland could freely use these music compositions or ambience tracks to help with that sonic void in their build. For example, games such as: Wondermine, Exodus, Butterfly Prawn, Golfcraft and more if they don’t yet have any music.\nSome of the plazas seem to be lacking sound including: Forest Plaza, Vegas Plaza and Medieval Plaza. These places feel rather dead to me when entering as there is nothing much to be heard.\n\nThe music as you enter Decentraland in Genesis Plaza is a great example of a parcel that effectively includes sound/music.\nSome other plazas like Soho Plaza, Asian Plaza and Gamer Plaza include background soundscapes which help immerse the player in the build.","specification":"Scope of delivery:\n6 to 9 field recordings for natural ambient tracks (captured on pro location audio recording equipment)\n6 to 9 music compositions of various styles (composed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\n6 to 9 electronic/synth ambient tracks (sound designed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\nA small collection of sound effects/foley for basic object interactions (doors opening and chests opening etc)\nThe plan will be to host these audio clips on a basic website/hosting service which I will set up myself with help from other community members who have offered me assistance.\nOne idea might be to create an “npm package”, have the audio files selectable by the owner/operator who can then stream the audio files to their build with just using some code in the SDK.\nI will likely host the audio clips as ogg vorbis as this is a great codec for high quality in a small file size format. However I will consult builders in the community to help me decide on optimization of the files for playback in Decentraland builds so things work smoothly.\n\nThese will all be freely available for anyone to use in Decentraland.

The district has 279 parcels thanks to MANA donations from 61 contributors. Since then, lack of capital has been a big hurdle for Nexus to deliver on its vision. Efforts to get 3d modelers and programmers to work for free failed. Skilled professionals want to be paid.\n\nRecently, the team commissioned conceptual designs and an urban plan for the district, and the results have been amazing. With grant funds, we can pay talented architects, modelers, and developers to complete and deploy this design.\n\nWe can create a new kind of commerce and entertainment district with cost-effective leasing options for any company or creator who doesn't want to buy land. By lowering the friction to set up a presence in Decentraland we plan to attract new companies and creators, and their followers, who might not come here otherwise.\n\nThe Nexus project is also partnering with [Parcel](https://parcel.so), the premier metaverse land marketplace, creator directory, and education platform, to present leasing opportunities to potential clients, including well-known companies and brands.\n\n**Cohesive Design and Planning**\n\nThe district design unites shops, galleries, anchor presences, a shared event space, and an open market plaza in a cohesive architectural whole. The initial design concept shows that Nexus can become a spectacular addition to Decentraland, attracting new brands, businesses, and players.\n\n![Nexus Crystal City concept](https://wonderzone.io/img/nexus/NexusCrystalConcept.png \"Nexus Crystal City concept\")\n\nThe large front area is a shared event space where events can be run by any Nexus tenant. It can be configured as a stage for concerts, or as a large screen viewing area for films and video streams.\n\nThe expansive corner quadrants are open to larger companies who want to house their HQ or other custom-built structures in Nexus. These are some of the anchors that should attract new attendees to the district, and benefit from the traffic brought in by other nearby tenants.\n\nThe dramatic \"Crystal City\" structure will become the main Nexus landmark. It's also practical. The larger structures can house multiple shops, galleries, and other leasable spaces.\n\nWe want to bring together world-class design and architecture, fun interactivity, real-world retail brands, and the Decentraland creator community. The resulting district and the attention it will garner could help cement Decentraland’s position as the leading metaverse platform, and demonstrate new use cases and experiences for the future.\n\n**Previous Work**\n\nThe team members are well positioned to deliver. They have already deployed a number of impressive builds in Decentraland. \n\n With the WonderZone team, Rob Dixon designed and created the [WonderZone Amusement Park](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-50%2C51) and the ever-popular WonderMine game.\n\nIn addition, [LEDY](https://ledy.io) has already built:\n\n* The [New Scirocco Resort](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-38%2C-105) from their [Extraverse](https://www.extraverse.xyz/) collection. Sold for 42 Eth.\n* The second resort NFT, [Grand Aurelia](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54).\n* The [607 Beverly Hills Metahouse](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a for-sale $9.4M mansion.\n* The [Ferrari 90210 home](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a real-world $17M home.","specification":"This grant will be used to fund four aspects of development:\n \n1. **Refine architectural design, urban planning, and layout.** Starting from the initial concept, we’ll add details regarding urban planning and a unified district map for the district. This will also include design style guidelines for modelers who will create individual structures on the map.\n\n2. **Build and deploy core structures and shared spaces.** This will include the central Crystal City, the plaza and event space, and the paths and common areas between the leasable lands. LEDY works with a network of talented modelers and can source the best ones to deliver the buildings, landscaping, and other elements we need.\n\n3. **Build interactive experiences.** We will pay developers to create unique interactive experiences in the district, so every visit is entertaining. One core experience is the convertible event space that can shift from an open music stage to a covered film theater. Other work involves support for easily setting up and configuring shops, gallery spaces, or marketplace booths for creators.\n\n4. **Brand awareness and public relations.** Building upon branding work being done with Parcel, we will involve a top PR agency to create awareness of Nexus and Decentraland in major media publications. This can attract more companies who are interested in leasing areas within Nexus, and by extension bring new players with them. LEDY’s recent work deploying real estate models in Decentraland to support luxury home sales, amplified by public relations campaigns, got them coverage on TV news and multiple real-world publications.\n\nThis grant alone is not enough to build out the entire district plus all the interactive experiences and commerce infrastructure we envision. We're starting with a relatively small grant so we can show positive results in the first 6 months. Then if there's a need for a future grant we'll have a solid track record of achievement first. Of course, we hope that after 6 months we'll lease many spaces in Nexus, making future grants unnecessary.\n\n**Benefits to the Decentraland Community**\n\nThis project could provide many benefits for the community:\n\n* The leasing model allows those who can’t afford land to set up their own shop, gallery, or other space. It can help **alleviate concerns about land scarcity pricing people out**. Leasable areas within Nexus can be as small as 1x2 parcels, with low leasing rates.\n\n* Our tenants share the common event space. It's more cost-effective for a company to build a Decentraland presence without having to buy extra parcels to build their own arena or theater. This might **attract companies that wouldn't come to Decentraland otherwise**.\n\n* New companies mean **new work for creators who can help them build out their presence**. We are working with Parcel’s Creatorverse program to find creators in the community who want to build out shops, galleries, and other spaces for tenants, and get paid for it.\n\n* **The more tenants in the district, the more everyone benefits**. We plan on a mix of large anchor presences, plus medium-sized and smaller spaces. Like a thriving mall, people might come to see one space, then be intrigued and investigate the whole district, discovering new creators and experiences as they go.\n\n* We want to make it **fun to visit Nexus every day**. We'll use learnings from other projects to build surprises, flexible features, frequent events, and even game-like features to keep things interesting.","personnel":"Decent Amusements LLC manages Nexus and the nearby WonderZone Park, one of the highest traffic areas in Decentraland.\n\nLEDY is a metaverse real estate developer with extensive experience building luxury metaverse content. \n\nParcel is a virtual real estate marketplace, creator directory and education platform uniquely positioned to offer everything people need to make the most of the metaverse.\n\n**Rob Dixon (Radix)**:\nActive in the Decentraland community since 2017.

Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.\n\nAnd YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland. \nWe will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.\n\nThis is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.\n\nWith this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.\n\nDCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.\n\nA short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying” and “renting land” services.\n\nWe’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale. We will appoint a board to adjust our own rate and commission, so it's fair and affordable. (Cheaper than today) Most likely 2,5% to 10% to the realtor platform.","specification":"Blockchain: Ethereum\n\nTools:\nvscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract\nReact, redux, tailwind for website\nReact, redux, react native for app\n\nIssue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space.

It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.\n\nSolution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed.

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players and thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Original proposal ###\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-bafkrei-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland/13138\n\n### TL;DR changes in resubmission ###\n- Renting land for a reduced price through [@dax](https://governance.decentraland.org/balance/?address=0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5)\n- Updated budget focused towards achieving a concrete six month Roadmap\n- More details re: past team experiences in game and software development\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an\nordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience\n\n### Scope ###\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of March\n2023. In that time our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have,\nby the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all\nDecentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics ###\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to\nDecentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n- A session in D&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n- An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n- Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating one themselves.","specification":"### How we see the final result: ###\n\n1. Each player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters.\n2. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\nin the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3. The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\nreceive a task from a non-player character in the story.\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a\ntavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Approach the tavern and start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nSome actions’ success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, to \"Sneak\nattack the guard\" you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is a 10; you roll the dice, if you roll a ten or lower you miss, greater than 10 and you hit.\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game\nends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another\ncharacter, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be\ncompletely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n\n\n\n### Budget Breakdown ###\n\n___Total: 60k___\n\n___Team Salaries: 49k___ \n- _15k SDK Dev_\n- _15k 3D Artists_\n- _8k  Game Designer_\n- _4k  Game Master_\n- _4k  2D Artist_\n- _3k  Sound Designer_\n\n___Marketing: 6k___\n\n___Servers and infrastructure: 3k___\n\n___Land Rental for 6 months: 2k___\n\n### Tech Stack ###\n\nMuch of the game will be built using the Decentraland SDK but part of the infrastructure will be external. For this we will use a custom built backend server to store player scores, preferences, gaming history, and more. \n\n### Revenue plan / Sustainability ###\n\nWhile we do plan to create some wearables and possibly make some purchases available, adding a large number of profit-making functions will greatly burden the project, and making a profit is not our goal.","personnel":"### Core team ###\n\n__Soulsinger__ - manager of the CEN studio; game designer;\nthe ideological inspirer of the project\n\n__Dax__ - SDK Developer\nIn Decentraland since 2017; \n10 years of software development experience; \nwinner of the 2022 DCL Game Jam\n\n__Casuallvl__ & __Orina__ - 3d artists. \nSpecialists in 3D modelling of low-poly objects\n\n__Master Eador__ - Gamemaster.\nLongtime TTRPG player;\n2 years experience as a professional gamemaster\n\n__Mia__ - 2d artist. \nArt student with experience in building game assets\n\n__Alexander__ - Sound designer. \nKnown in some circles as ‘The Man with Three Ears’\n\n### Relevant experience ###\n\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years.

This economy data can feed in to the AI to provide the highest-quality classifications of users for the entire gaming industry to empower LiveOps campaigns, advertising & marketing, increasing Ad Delivery revenue generation, and so much more.\n\nAs a result, we have the best AI platform on the market to:\n\nEnrich any data, (1st, 2nd, or 3rd party data),\nClassify and categorise data and contextual behaviours at scale,\nFeed creators' own data back to them to further optimise their experiences for more engagement and retention.\n\n\nAND TOGETHER\n\nBy combining Engine's ability to manage economic instances with Thunderstruck's ability to turn those economic instances into actionable insights, which can in turn be used to further optimise economic instances to maximise player retention and engagement in terms of both time and money spent in play and platform, we can help Decentraland, and its creators to design and run more fun, and more profitable metaverse expenses to convert intrinsic value into shared extrinsic value and virtuous cycles for all parties.","specification":"Thunderstruck version 1 is already live.\n\nEngine version 1 launches on the 1st of September 2022.\n\nSee our product demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/8152f63ee96846ebaa508fd65fffeba2\n\nEngine product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/The-Economy-Engine-b6e3b6ca58a14669a8d420acc1727650\n\nThunderstruck product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/Thunderstruck-AI-\n\nData connection catalogue (what kind of data our platform can handle): http://eventcatalog.metanomic.net/\n\nTech architecture map: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GslYHTg-B--5k_HMpcg7s0eRQdTurLU6ErVBhSuCogA/edit#slide=id.g10f846c6006_0_0\n\nOur primary focus now is to place these powerful tools into the hands of the Web3 creator economy by partnering with key metaverse players and platforms - like Decentraland.

We witnessed multiple potential tenants reaching out to us to learn more about the rental process as our website helped them connect with land owners. However, we also soon learned that Decentraland remains largely inaccessible to the average person looking to advertise, market their products, or celebrate/host events on it.\n\nWhile we were able to make the lands more discoverable through our platform, the process of actually using the land remains much more complicated. Decentraland allows land owners to grant temporary edit permissions to another user for their land (https://docs.decentraland.org/market/land-manager/#give-permissions) but in order for the tenants to work with it, they need to be well-versed with deploying code to build something in DCL. The problem is that in many cases the tenants don’t really need these permissions and just want to connect and work with the land owner on how they plan to use the land. \n\nThink of the following major use cases for example:\n1.  A production company wants to promote their upcoming film on someone’s land, they would like to directly ask the land owner to put up a poster or some other graphic on a particular asset on the land, for instance, a billboard. Or basically, any other company looking to advertise or market their product’s info on someone’s land.\n2. A family wants to celebrate a birthday party or some other similar event in DCL, they want to use an existing parcel/estate without any changes and all they require is the land owner’s help to let them host the event. \n\nNeither of these above cases require the involvement of a smart contract or any sort of transfer of ownership or other permissions, and the whole process can be worked out simply by connecting and communicating with potential tenants. And so, RentParcel will build a platform that will make it extremely simple to connect with land owners for anyone who’s trying to utilize Decentraland but doesn’t have any advanced knowledge of crypto, nfts, or the metaverse.  \n\nHow is this happening currently?\n\nCurrently, if potential customers want to connect with land owners they do it largely through Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media sources, which is mostly unorganized. There are also metaverse real estate agents and advertising firms that act as middlemen or brokers for facilitating ‘rentals’. Our vision is to democratize access to Decentraland land and create a level playing field in terms of opportunities for land owners. By building a peer-to-peer marketplace, we would be able to have a single dedicated space where anyone can connect with DCL land owners, use their land, leave reviews, and just help make the entire process more open, accessible, and transparent.","specification":"RentParcel will streamline the process of using someone’s land - we plan to model our website in the following manner:\n\n1. For land owners: Land owners would go to our website and create a post for their property (wallet integration will not be mandatory) which will also include the price per day for using their land and the availability.  \n\n2. For customers (any person, entity, or organisation) looking to use DCL land for whatever their need is - renting, marketing, events, etc., would then browse through this website and select their property of interest and duration (for which they intend to use the land), and they will then request to communicate directly with the land owner. \n\nThe land owner will then get a notification that someone is interested in their land and it will be up to them to accept/reject the invite to initiate the conversation. Once the details such as price, duration, etc are finalized, RentParcel will let the land owner set a price and duration which would be then sent to the tenant customer to accept. The exact reason for using the land will be something that will be worked out between the two parties.      \n\nIn addition, we will also include features that can be found on popularly existing marketplace like websites such as leaving reviews/ratings both for landlords and customers, searching, filtering on price, land type, size, etc.\n\nWe plan to use the requested funds for the following:\n1. Accelerating the development of the project and creating informational content - we will hire more developers to expedite the completion of the project. We’ll also retain video editors to create educational content for both land owners and tenants on how to go about using space in DCL for hosting events or advertising. \n2. Marketing - We will also retain an experienced and dedicated marketing personnel who would oversee search engine optimisation (SEO), design our online ads strategy, and handle social media engagement to help increase customer traction for the land owners.  \n3. Establishing Partnerships - We are currently focussed more on Decentraland and will work to partner with companies trying to bring experiences or replicating real world events in DCL by persuading them to use our platform so that land owners are benefited.","personnel":"Aditya - Software Engineer\n\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxena-aditya/\n\nGitHub - https://github.com/aditya800\n \nTave - Software Engineer, Computer Science degree from New York University.  \n\nBoth of us are full stack software engineers with experience working at Microsoft & Amazon, and will be putting up to $1K USD collectively out of our own pocket too for the project.","roadmap":"We plan to complete the project within 8-10 weeks, here are the goals we’re setting:  \n\n1.

The answer is simply to harness the power of the cloud, efficiently and securely.\n\nWith a combined 30+ years of experience in cloud consulting with some of the largest fortune 500 companies through infrastructure, development, automation, and cybersecurity. Not to mention we’re a strong player within the community – Serraform is uniquely positioned to deliver a self-service video streaming platform for Decentraland that is fully-automated and simple to use.\n\nWith your support, we plan to further invest in the development of a streaming platform hosted in the cloud and secured with state-of-the-art cybersecurity and compliant solutions. To do this we need to take what we’ve learned and built so far and automate its ability to service you at a moment’s notice. We need the service to scale beyond what our team can manage and let anybody use it themselves when they want, while reducing overall running costs for the community.\n\nWe need to develop an interface and an API that can be used for any parcel owner to leverage the power of our streaming platform, allowing the ability for users to upload any audio/video file for streaming, or copy/paste in a Twitch/YouTube stream URL for those who prefer that route. We also know the community wants to broadcast Zoom podcasts or OBS streams directly into Decentraland but lack the ability to do it at scale and without jitter – we've been servicing all these use-cases, and now we need to package it up in a simple to use service for anybody to use on their own time. Simply upload your video, paste your link, or request a RTMP URL/key and let the fully automated service handle the rest.\n\nIf you’re a developer you might build an interface inside Decentraland or within your own tool if you prefer not to use ours, then leverage our API to deliver on the streaming magic for you. Rent out your venue and allow guests to control their content natively inside your own parcel. Have a club night where your VIP guests control the stream via Twitch or a jukebox collection of content over a stream deck you built! The possibilities will be endless, and this is just the beginning.\n\n**Feature highlights PowerPoint:** https://tinyurl.com/5b58ccx9","specification":"We plan to develop this solution on Microsoft Azure cloud using fully automated code to provision isolated streaming “tenants” using modern DevOps practices. We believe the solution should be cloud-native and have no single points of failure or need for manual intervention, while being able to deliver on your security and compliance needs with maximum horsepower and optimum user experience across the globe.\n\nIn addition to our proposed website UI, we plan to develop an API ‘under the hood’ to allow 3rd party app integration, allowing anybody to integrate their own parcel and control preferences with our streaming solution, either in-game or through 3rd party tooling or websites. **Why not build your own jukebox collection and let party-goers control your screens within your parcel? Imagine building a stream deck inside your venue!**\n\nThe content will be encoded with H.264 studio-grade quality up to 1080p, optimized for Decentraland events, and securely stored using Microsoft’s award-winning Defender security toolset. The streams will be provided as adaptive M3U8 streams, meaning various bitrates and resolutions will be available, accommodating any bandwidth limitations – this basically means **you get a buffer-free experience on every stream at the best quality possible anywhere and on any device**.\n\nThe service will support ingestion of any external stream (via OBS or Zoom for example) using an RTMP URL/key pair, but also **be able to broadcast streams directly from Twitch and/or YouTube** if you already have a URL.\n\nWe plan to leverage Verizon’s global premium CDN network allowing for dedicated content delivery to anybody around the world at very low latency and zero buffering. We want to be able to ingest any video source, and re-broadcast it directly into Decentraland, providing a **great viewing experience for over 1700+ user events. No more skipping OBS streams for large audiences!**\n\nWe currently offer this as a service, and we manage it ourselves on behalf of our customers.

Often the first question asked of teams looking to build or sell in Decentraland focuses on the metaverse itself and not the team’s use case; although Decentraland is the most decentralized metaverse it still exists in a competitive landscape. Investors and clients often need to justify investment or choice of metaverse before they can start to focus on a team’s specific use case.\n \nBy providing data on Daily Active Users, Total User Growth of Decentraland, and traffic by parcel, builders can refer to these open source analytics instead of each team attempting to obtain them by themselves.\n \n**2. \tPrevent undue load on Decentraland Infrastructure**\n \nWhile the data in question is public, everyone cannot query this data for themselves without an adverse impact on Decentraland nodes.\n \nThere has already been discussion in the forums about shutting down external access to player position data due to increased loads felt by Decentraland content server nodes. Too many concurrent requests to these endpoints would have the effect of a DDoS attack which could impact the quality of the service each node can provide.\n \nTherefore instead of a) playing out the Tragedy of the Commons that would occur if everyone collected the data for themselves, b) removing access such that nobody can benefit from this data, or c) allowing the data to be acquired by the highest bidder/private entity – we believe the ecosystem will benefit most from the data collection being done once and everyone sharing in access to that data.\n \n**3. \tPrevent Private Monopolization of the Data**\n \nWe at Atlas CORP have first-hand knowledge of how valuable this data can be to those operating in Decentraland. User position data can be used to determine how many users attended events – critical for event hosts to understand how well their event performed. Daily active user data is crucial to those seeking to invest in the metaverse to help understand returns on investment.\n \nWe believe that no private institution should be able to gate-keep this information from the rest of the community. We at Atlas CORP used to make this information freely available using our own private hosting infrastructure, but we outpaced our capacity requiring a move to more dynamic scaling solutions. This is why we’re here talking about this proposal.\n\n**tl;dr**\n \nThe DAO can provide the Decentraland community a free source of user data via API for up to one year for the cost of $57,300. The existence of this data set will help to grow the builder and entrepreneurial community by providing important metrics needed to win clients and funding, and prevent monopolization by private entities. Atlas CORP is the suitable candidate for this development given an extensive history in Decentraland data collection and analytics.","specification":"**What Data is in Scope?**\n \nThis proposal is only for Decentraland user data as reported by the /comms/islands endpoint on Decentraland Content Servers.\n \nThis proposal does NOT include:\n* Content Server data (e.g. scene files, user profile history)\n* Scene-specific data (e.g. object clicks and interactions)\n* Any personally identifiable information (PII), excluding ETH wallet address\n* User IRL location data\n* Any derived content from a user’s ETH wallet\n \nData will be collected from all active, registered Decentraland Content Servers which at the time of writing includes hephaestus, hela, heimdallr, baldr, loki, dg, odin, unicorn, marvel, and athena.\n \nThis data set can provide a platform for building more sophisticated reports by the DCL developer community. The DAO could also choose to one day monetize access to this data (e.g. when the data is being used directly for profit), as well as augment what data is collected and made available. It is important to note that this proposal is currently limited in scope to the one data set and free access to the community, and that these next steps may be the subject of future proposals.\n  \n**How will this work?**\n \nData will be collected every 20 seconds and piped into a Mongo Atlas cloud database, with a Digital Ocean server set up to provide API access to queries on the data.\n \nAn automated feed will be set up to collect data from an authoritative source of each active DAO node. Collecting data every 20 seconds will result in 3 datapoints a minute; graphs using one-minute granularity will have 3 datapoints on which to aggregate data points per minute. Data collection will be set up redundantly on two or more servers, or on a single load-balanced cluster, to minimize downtime in data collection. This data is expected to grow at 1Gb per day, which may accelerate with the growth of daily active users.\n \nAs the data is natively in JSON, we propose to use Mongo Atlas as the cloud database of choice. The database will also be deployed with multiple nodes to minimize downtime. Mongo provides an easy way to scale for future needs – whether through increasing storage capacity or sharding the deployment for increased API and query load.\n \nTo minimize infrastructure costs, we propose keeping only 3 months of data available for public consumption. A process will be designed to backup, purge, and post/host historical data such that users can perform historical analysis without excessive cost to the DAO.\n \nAn API server will be written to provide simplified API access to the data in the database. These queries may include things like – users per minute (global or per parcel), daily active users (global or per parcel), and unique Decentraland visitors (global or per parcel). The API code can be made open source and hosted on GitLab, but hosted privately on Digital Ocean to prevent unauthorized access to the DAO’s database. Additional access can be granted to additional DAO representatives if deemed appropriate.\n \nAPI access will remain open, although a throttling mechanism will be put in place per IP address to prevent DDoS of the API servers. In addition, query data (e.g. who’s asking for what) could be saved in the database and made available as APIs for complete transparency.\n \nA dashboard will be made available to show recent Decentraland population data and daily active users for the reportable data set.","personnel":"The Development Team\n \nThe development of this data platform would be done by the Atlas Corporation [@atlascorp_dcl](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl) team, who have extensive experience working with this data set:\n \n* HowieDoin – Lead Analytics & Infrastructure innovation\n* MorrisMustang – Lead DCL & Solidity innovation\n* JosephAaron – Operations and task management\n* StaleDegree – Senior Solidity/UI Development\n* RyanNFT – Junior Developer","roadmap":"**What will this cost the Decentraland DAO?**\n \nThis project will cost the DAO $57,300 and will take approximately 3 months to develop.\n \nThis breaks down into:\n \n**$7,500.00*** **- Infrastructure and Hosting Costs:**\n* Budget for Mongo Atlas DB for one year\n* Budget for Digital Ocean API servers for one year\n* Budget for Digital Ocean Data collection servers for one year\n* ENS domain for three years\n\n**This estimate is based on current pricing for each of the above platforms. $7,500 may not last a full year if pricing is altered by the provider.*\n \n**$45,000.00- Development Costs (estimated 3 month delivery)**\n* Data collection with redundancy and failover to set up the data collection \nrails\n* API query development resources to produce queries and prevent \noveruse\n* DevOps and infrastructure development resources to automate as much \nas possible\n* Technical Writing resources to provide user-facing API documentation\n* Front-end development resources to create the dashboard\n \n**$4,800 - Ongoing Support Costs (3 months post deployment)**\n* Code updates when breaking changes occur due to external forces\n* API query user support in the Decentraland discord","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":13409,"scores_total":3868687.136637649,"votes":75,"manaVP":334591.4333183406,"landVP":268000,"namesVP":114400,"delegatedVP":3151695.7033193093,"vesting_address":"0x6141047169e6df0822b47687a1be516b2bd28d29","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4","size":57300,"beneficiary":"0xe64581F067Cfdce58657E3c0F58175e638C30f2B","token":"DAI","vesting_released":57300,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2022-08-09T21:10:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2023-02-05T21:10:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":57300,"vesting_status":"Finished","done_updates":4,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":2,"update_status":"done","health":"onTrack","last_update":"2023-01-12T16:46:26.882Z","pending_updates":2},{"id":"99986a30-0cb5-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b","snapshot_id":"bafkreieck4ay7lsd26nbu7dlr2yyymy3ttb7bdu6fvc7odueq2vd3j3uiq","user":"0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2b9c4b263","type":"grant","title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","start_at":"2022-07-26T07:36:00.387Z","finish_at":"2022-08-02T07:36:00.386Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Vueltta x NFT Show Europe: Art Installation to Increase Decentraland Engagement","abstract":"Vueltta is an international art collective creating immersive experiences in Decentraland.

Inside each labyrinth, visitors will experience contemporary art in an entirely new way. \n\nFirst coined by researcher Dr. John Rhodes in 2006, ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ describes the states of mind evoked by walking a labyrinth. According to Rhodes, labyrinths create liminal spaces which promote ‘flashes of intuition, insight and openness’. \n\n**Vueltta’s labyrinths seek to bring this liminal experience into the metaverse.**\n\n*‘Labyrinths are an ancient archetype dating back 4,000 years or more.

As artists, we’re committed to using Decentraland to find new dimensions for contemporary art. \n\nWe believe creative teams like ours can go far beyond ‘NFTs in frames’ to provide immersive experiences - engaging new audiences both with art and with Decentraland. These ‘non-gaming’ experiences have significance for brands, artists and creative agencies evaluating their entry into the metaverse.\n\n**Motivation 2: Engage a wider creative community with DCL**\n\nThe Labyrinth Effect will be presented at [NFT Show Europe](https://nftshoweurope.com/) to some of the most important digital artists working today.

This makes live events infeasible. For example, live video calls or interactive events take 20 seconds to get a response.\n\nThis project introduces new ultra low latency streaming components to the decentraland SDK and builder to support ultra low latency video. Latency will reduce to ~1 second.\n\nThese components will allow scene builders to easily incorporate ultra low latency video in their scenes.\n\n### Background\n\nIn recent years, global investment in technology and infrastructure underlying ultra low latency video streaming has been significant.  Live streaming is set to explode in the coming years with low latency video being a big driver behind new applications in entertainment, gaming, media, education, acedemia.\n\nUltra low latency video streaming typically operates on a sub 1 second delay.\nThis project will integrate this hot, deep technology into the Decentraland platform.\n\n### Competitive Advantage\n\nMetaverses such as Facebook's Meta already have native low-latency video\nand are building a strong portfolio of apps based on this technology. Other\nMetaverses do not yet have low latency video streaming technology.\n\n### Experimental Prototype\n\nA video demonstration of the components I have developed is here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ml7nlTEk3p8\n\nThis video shows a working prototype of an experimental Decentraland SDK component featuring a low latency video stream.\n\nThe video is streaming from North America to a video streaming server in Hong Kong (on Microsoft Azure) and then back to North America and into a Decentraland scene running in the browser.\n\nThe clock times on the right side are the current time whereas the time on the left, in the Decentraland scene, are latent due to the transit time around the planet and the subsequent decoding and rendering of the video.\n\nTotal time is demonstrated to be around 1 second.\n\nA 5 year old laptop with no GPU was used for the test. The video resolution is set to 640x360.\n\nThe experimental prototype includes modifications to the Decentraland Unity Renderer and Kernel and adds a new video component to the SDK.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a virtual future that runs on a 20 second delay.  Use cases that need lower latency might include:\n\n- Any live interaction such as video calls.\n- Live events where people communicate from the virtual world to the real world.\n- Any use cases that include augmentation of the virtual world with a real object (augmented virtuality).\n- Virtual workspaces\n- Virtual learning spaces that requires interaction\n- Remote control of real world devices such as drones. (yikes!)\n- Immersive commerce\n- Gaming applications\n\n### Existing DAO pre-Proposal\n\nAn existing pre-proposal that covers this feature is here, from Tobik#7989. Note however this is a request for a protocol change, the proposed feature would likely be an additional component so that backwards compatibility is maintained:\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240","specification":"### High Level Summary\n\nThe project objective is to create a feature to enable scene builders to easily incorporate low latency video into their scenes. To be successful the feature needs to be well engineered, tested, documented, incorporate ideas from dev and user communities and comply with Decentraland standards.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Deliver WebRTC ultra low video and audio streaming components to the Decentraland SDK.\n- Support for Decentraland web client and feasibility of development on new Desktop client on supported platforms.\n- Complete all relevant requirement, archiectural, design, code, test and deployment work to decentraland's standard via github.  \n- Run relevant user testing and trials.\n- Operate a streaming test server until mid November 2022 for development and community testing.\n- Create test scenes, sdk documentations, blogs and assist Decentraland marketing team on new feature launch.\n- Be responsive to community and be present in relevant channel on Discord.\n- Attend some sweet dcl live events that use the new technology.\n\n### Preliminary Work Completed\n\nA feasibility study was completed prior to grant application request:\n- Talking to potential users and understanding their applications.\n- Review of code and relevant architectural components.\n- Reading Dcl code standards and architecture documentation.\n- Research of ECS (sdk) structure and dev of new components.\n- Review of existing decentraland video components.\n- Review of WebRTC options for Unity and their pros and cons.\n- Building new environment across Explorer, Kernel and Unity Renderer. Building and debugging scenes.\n- Experimentation and development of prototype including modifications the the sdk Unity Renderer and Kernel.\n- Running live streams in Preview scenes in decentraland.\n- Testing live streams on Mac, Windows and across browsers.

Link to our website https://cenmodels.com\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years. We sincerely love games and our work. A year ago, we started to see the potential in Decentraland. We studied the specifics of Decentraland and spent thousands of hours at work. And now, when we know we can create high-quality content, we turn to DAO, to people who believe in the success of Decentraland as much as we do and who, like us, want to participate in its development. We know it is only the beginning of our great journey in improving the Decentraland.\n \n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland, which will entail its advancement.\n \n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won't be a 100% copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics for several reasons:\n- Specifics of computer games. \n- Limitations of Decentraland. \n- Rules that are easy to understand. Even if you didn't play games like D&D before. \nOther reasons.\n\n\nExamples of different game mechanics:\n- A session in D&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n- An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n- Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating them themselves.\n\n \nExpenditure of funds:\n- Purchasing a 2x3 land to place the game on it. To date, the cheapest 2x3 plots are in this price range. People who have made content for Decentraland or have some knowledge about Builder know that acceptable values for triangles, materials, textures, and so on depend on the number of adjacent sections. The 2x3 plot is the minimum size to make beautiful and diverse models of characters, scenery, effects, and other things. (22 000 - 30 000$)\n\n- Programmer's salary. A programmer is one of the most important specialists in game development. (16 000 - 18 000$)\n\n- The salary of two 3d artists. Our modelers face a difficult task. They need to meet the scene's limitations but, at the same time, make a lot of diverse, maximally optimized models. (14 000 - 16 000$)\n\n- Game designer's salary. The game designer will have to think through all the game mechanics and assemble them into a single whole. (8000 - 10 000$)\n\n- Gamemaster's salary. As I said before, our team is big fans of D&D, but we decided to call a professional for the role of the gamemaster. The gamemaster will create 2 intriguing game scenarios with many ramifications and a variety of game passing. They will come up with characters, their personalities, the world and the laws by which they live, and much more. (4000 - 5000$)\n\n- Artist's salary. The artist will draw hero cards, interfaces, backgrounds, and so on. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Sound designer's salary. Audio is a crucial component of the atmosphere for better immersion. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n- Other expenses. Various services, servers, etc. (5 000$)\n\n- Marketing. We will cover this amount using our own funds. We need to make a statement! (10 000 - 12 000$)","specification":"First, the gamemaster and the game designer will create the game's foundation. They'll decide which mechanics to replicate from D&D, which to change, and which to add. They'll develop 2 adventure scenarios and think through all the dialogues, the variability of actions, characters, etc.\n Then they split into two teams:\n1) The gamemaster will start working with an artist, a sound designer, and one of the 3d artists. This team will be responsible for the lore of the game, its appearance, and its sound.\n2) The game designer will work with a programmer and a second 3d artist. Their main task will be to make gameplay and smart objects.\nEven though they'll divide into two other teams, both groups will work closely to ensure that all aspects of the game are compatible.\n\n\nHow we see the final result (in short):\nEach player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences. The characters get into some situations and receive a task. For example, players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf. The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions (\"Inspect the tavern,\" \"Approach the tavern and start talking to him\"...). Some actions' success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, in \"Strike a stealthy attack at a robber,\" - you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is, for example, 10; you roll the dice, if <10 falls out - you missed, >10 - you hit. In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players' characters have died.\nFor a complete understanding, check out D&D if you don't know what kind of game it is.\n\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.","personnel":"- Programmer.

This is what DCL set out to do, co-create the Metaverse, but believe there can be more contributors to the Metaverse puzzle. \n\nOur guiding compass is to encourage architecture in the Metaverse and to develop a new economic model for architects/3D designers in the process of architecting the Metaverse. With an active influx of high-quality buildings to DCL there will be more experiences for users rather than vast areas of barren land. We are also confident that monthly user adoption and user-generated events will also rise. For such a task to occur we need to revolutionise the way the marketplace, builder and SDK currently operate. \n\nRenovi believes that to build further, more complex and enticing experiences within DCL the correct stakeholders need to be rewarded for creating. This implies that high-quality, professional architects/3D designers but also upcoming talent needs to be interested and more importantly motivated to create for the Metaverse. \n\nArchitects/3D Designers can now break their real-life moulds and find new monetary avenues by leveraging their efforts for exponential development through DCL. \n\nFollowing on from our successful poll “Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?” (Link: https://bit.ly/3P1dybU) we have taken onboard the feedback from the various stakeholders and revised our approach to offer a better solution. \n\nWe aim to create cross-platform compatible 3D asset NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. We want to create a seamless experience in which a creator can upload a 3D asset in Renovi Marketplace (or any other marketplace) and put it for sale. Consequently the buyer of that 3D asset now an NFT will be able to navigate directly from the marketplace to the DCL builder in which they can find the asset as a new asset pack. Within a few clicks, they should be able to place the asset on their land and if further alterations are required they can download the scene so it can be altered on the SDK. \n\nTo achieve this we will integrate the Renovi marketplace to DCL by building part of the DCL API links so that 3D assets are compatible and can be presented in the builder as long as they belong to the respective user’s wallet. This will enable us to automate the current procedure. Currently, the buyer of a 3D asset needs to download it and reupload it to the builder while at the same time there is no clear way of ensuring they are the owners of that building as an NFT. We will offer a single, simple streamlined solution for DCL.\n\nAs part of giving back to the community, we will also need to ensure that there is API compatibility between DCL products and Renovi Marketplace or any other marketplace. We want to make it possible that everyone who purchases a 3D asset as an NFT that is compatible with DCL can connect their wallet, navigate to the builder of DCL and be able to find the respective 3D asset as an external asset pack that can be placed on their land.\n\nOur goal is to automate the implementation pipeline, and indirectly add buildings as NFTs into DCL by opening up the builder and its capabilities to a wider audience.\n\nWebsite: https://renovi.io  \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/eMEPwxCyEk  \n\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3P3MNn2","specification":"How can we achieve this?\n\nTo achieve a technical specification of this magnitude, we will need to carefully craft and technically architect each stage of our infrastructure and execution. This will entail developing an API, which we will label as the “industry standard” prototype for interoperable communication. Developing a standard will be subject to outlining in full, all parameters that are currently present within DCL technical ecosystem. E.g. project name, parcel type, parcel dimensions, file type, price, chain, triangles, materials, meshes, bodies, entities and textures etc. \n\nThis will be followed by documentation, enabling a user to educate themselves on creating GET/POST requests to and from the Renovi and DCL ecosystems. All API calls will be open and provided to the public to interact with. We will allow users to obtain authentication mechanisms in the form of bearer tokens, from us, which can be invoked/revoked at any time, to facilitate the usage of our API. Upon integration and authentication, with industry standards, the user will be able to interact with the API to either fetch, embed, post, and/or utilise all the parameters available for each Metaverse asset.\n\nAt MVP stages, these interactions will bypass through a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) built on NodeJS and/or equivalent, as this enables us to interact with the blockchain using web3 infrastructure. Once an API request is authenticated and a user has posted their metaverse asset for approval, their user ID, wallet ID and asset ID will be manually (at first) approved and sent to the DCL builder. The CMS will enable any admin to utilise the CRUD convention (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) along with import/exporting any assets needed, to open communication lines between the CMS and the DCL builder. This could function in a similar way to approving DCL wearables.\n\nSome of our previous work creating for DCL \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/13Zxq0vEFG0wY_wn9ivqAcsexGbKrhzcK/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5WstmHEmTw4wGQQir92j52v-qVwiVc1/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1QPiPG53ucwWgdLyakvIwBRVxTDGgq7Q3/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10XSz4_MWEJDuOhNyhkFdVLvtqXaZArUg/view?usp=sharing","personnel":"Jacob Papageorgiou - CTO/ Co-Founder of Renovi together with a team of 6 talented full-stack web, DevOps, blockchain engineers and 2 UIUX Designers under his management will be able to execute these goals promptly. \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-papa/ \n\nhttps://github.com/mostmojo \n\nIn the last decade, Jacob has led teams in the U.S and U.K and has worked alongside developers of the likes of TransferWise & Revolut. \n\nHe's been a Technical Advisor to Blockchain and Private Equity startups and has led tech teams with clients of the likes of Nike, Vodafone, Adidas, National Lottery, Gordon Ramsay and UCL. \n\nHe has been a fellow educator for Brixton-based code camps and global leading tech boot camp Le Wagon, before founding Mojo Digital of which he has a client base of over 300 web applications/sites to date before co-founding Renovi. \n\nAdditionally, he’s been on the board of Coin Mara, an African Startup as a Technical Architect, that raised over $30M from Coinbase Ventures, Huobi and more.","roadmap":"Create a cross-platform connection for 3D assets that are NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. \n\nRebuild part of Decentraland’s existing builder so that 3D Assets that are NFTs can flow directly from marketplaces to the DCL builder.\n\n40K 4 months\n\nBuild an API layer of communication enabling the user to transfer NFTs from a marketplace to a DCL builder.\n\n34K 3 months\n\nEnsure API compatibility between DCL products, Renovi Marketplace but also other marketplaces such as Opensea.

Compatibility with digital fashion is the holy grail of this task. NFT technology promises interoperability, but all games/metaverses/apps have different avatars, graphic styles, and poly-counts for assets. There is no standard. So we also have multiple 3D files for each digital outfit. In order to support “interoperability” companies drop separate NFTs compatible with different metaverses. They are not linked. It is just creating a new copy of the design. None of them are compatible. They are not very useful for use outside of the platform on which they were created, and duplicating designs for portability to different worlds blurs the ownership, value and uniqueness of assets. \n\nSolution: \nWe’ve built an infrastructure that allows a single EVM-compatible asset to be worn not only in the game marketplace it was bought in, but in all worlds, everywhere it goes it converts to the appearance of the platform it’s in. We tap into the backend of metaverse marketplaces to make these assets tradable in-game. On the contrary of our competitors, who drop separate NFTs compatible for the different virtual worlds, our infrastructure does not create a duplicate of NFTs. Each 1 NFT works as an access pass to the compatible version of 3D asset for multiple metaverses/games/VR/AR/Zoom filters etc.\n\n\nDecentraland have been the first who started to support linked wearable, but our project serves to extend this capability to many other worlds and provide single window for the users/brands/metaverses.","specification":"We have described our tech in the following article: https://medium.com/gravity-the-studio\n\nOur demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNAj7YMWpSo&t=1s \nOur website:  https://gravitylayer.io\nGithub: https://github.com/Gravity-Studio-Digital-Wear\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gravitylayer/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GravitySkins\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Ejh4jEPRDC\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravitylayer/","personnel":"Our team for now consist of 10 full time team members and 2 ongoing freelancers.\nOur CEO and co-founder background is in ad agencies, her master’s research was in 3D fashion and digital identity.

Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.\n\nMetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.\n\nOur intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale. The MetaMundo platform integration will also function as an active onramp for new 3D artists into Decentraland.\n\nReference links:\n\n [Website](https://metamundo.co/)\n\n [Discord](https://discord.gg/metamundo)\n\n [Twitter](https://twitter.com/metamundo_NFT)\n\n[Medium](https://metamundo.medium.com/)","specification":"To develop a seamless deployment solution, it’s important to describe and breakdown how MetaMundo supports 3D creators to optimize and mint their models into 3D NFTs optimized for Decentraland. The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.\n\nWe will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.\n\nOur servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.\n\nWe plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.\n\nOur goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:\n\n![ZenGarden by Dutchtide!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-ukbQAoh7USitMFCzs8C13fUd6PW9PhY \"ZenGarden by Dutchtide\")\n\n![metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lX7UaWfZR32JsFIaUcwTqVM4xIfGM9_ \"metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5\")\n\n![Creature House by Mila Lolli!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-p8jY6yd64irLt4tY3kqC5Hx5O9wQLoK \"Creature House by Mila Lolli!\")","personnel":"**Mark** - Co-founder - Serial tech entrepreneur - launched multiple platforms to empower architects, designers and creators.

The creators bravely and creatively expressed their own vision of \"Kaleidoverse\" in their designs. Hundreds of wonderful works have been collected in each track, including future metaverse fashion items, metaverse products with multiple values and innovations, and also delicate space design, exploring the boundaries of space design in the metaverse. We believe that these works represent the expectations of many creators for the future metaverse, and we believe that these works can realize their value and make a contribution to the metaverse. We'd like to help make them visible to more people, giving outstanding creators a chance to make their mark in the metaverse and help add more innovation to the industry.​ \n\n  **_Why sponsor this competition?_**\n\n  **1.

For example, excellent clothing works will be made into wearable devices, and excellent space designs will be achieved in the land of DCL.\n\n **4.

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period.\n\n20k backend development = 3,3k/month\n\n10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month\n\n5k web development = 800$/month\n\n15k marketing = 2.5k/month\n\n5k  Discord maintenance = 900$/month\n\n5k  Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners.

We both want to see an open-source alternative to Meta. We also know that there's a lot of work to be done to get there.\nThis proposal is our first step towards that vision.\n\n### Vision\nWe would love to see a thriving community of Decentraland game creators enabled by an ecosystem of tools that support them. Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.\nThe long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.\nTo achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.\n\n![Pixel art character concept art](https://d3da1k6uo8tbjf.cloudfront.net/edd84342-f714-11ec-8fd8-b2d1a80aa527?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22PixelArtCharacter%20Presentados.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27PixelArtCharacter%2520Presentados.png&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAS5PME4CT5QW2PJJU%2F20220628%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220628T204139Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c436f20009faf4e0ef686af1913333050cc54a4c078150cb4cc1c27a2f163974&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kM2RhMWs2dW84dGJqZi5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9lZGQ4NDM0Mi1mNzE0LTExZWMtOGZkOC1iMmQxYTgwYWE1Mjc~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_&Signature=qNUO6ENCDRXzJZGNR2al2iXX7u10HSsaaPB0N0mam-l~LmIUByjxSL5cNrViDmxLbAy32rTPJRYXUK44QR51puMUAvkl0C6DOUJGcCVJ7YH7H6nW-6HFxqgbTeuiVW0NESrBzP4i85kJovCeIa0E5dqeGcFndlG0STktmb07DeLANrPY25kcxxPlL7p7E6TwP8dA7ImMaSOL0LeA76Lq6MAwnSOlsPiaSBCIlZwbsHxzNxSjENh1MiyOGnAXKTodCuhSwhk-636A-HCk4PIaHrVplCbEjR6sioO65jYhtYubmwjHIbW36IoqlPCnyk7Z4gZq5BFa63YXvo7etyjREA__&Key-Pair-Id=K2BMZZDBFKKL41)","specification":"In order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.\n\nYou may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.\n\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700_3735892699868507_512428938455866077_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s640x640&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna&oh=00_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA&oe=62C136F0)\n\nThe main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:\n1. An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.\n2. A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).\n3. The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.\n4. A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.\n5. Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.\n\nWith these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.\n\nAs a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.\n\nOut of scope for this prototype:\n\n* Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).\n* Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.\n* Implementing a 2D sample game.","personnel":"**[frantufro](https://frantufro.com)** is a game and software developer with 20 years of experience and the owner and director of [Hidden People Club](https://hiddenpeople.club), a small game development team located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In a classic version of the game, win conditions are met by eliminating the opponent group. But we want to make it possible to join a game instance that has already started.","specification":"Game mechanic\n\nMinimum is 4 players. A game is usually played by 7-16 people. With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning. For this version 4 players for a start should be enough.\nA player get near a table, click on it, gets a message in a window if he is able to join a game instance. Users are able to join during a certain phase of the game. If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.\n\nZero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K \nWhere M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.\nFirst phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.\nSecond phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.\nThen everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.\n\nIf a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.\n\nAfter the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.\n\nNew players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.\n\nIf within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThis project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.\nVoting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.\nWe plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene.","personnel":"We are M-social Production, web and web3 developers, we have been doing digital projects since 2008.\nThere will be 4 people engaged in development:\n - Frontend dev\n - Backend dev\n - QA specialist\n - Project manager\n\nIf you want to know more about our experience, you can visit our website: https://msocialproduction.com","roadmap":"We expect a working alpha to be done within 3 weeks.\nWithin 2 weeks, we plan to make the functional code.

Then the electricity consumed is evaluated in the different location. This energy calculation should include the end user device, the networking and the servers of the metaverse. \nOnce the energy is evaluated for each location (granularity of a country), a new NFT is created including the extract of all the related certificate based on the preferred energy type (e.g. wind, solar…).","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":49997,"beneficiary":"0x73c4914A6Ec3E450A52B90bd7fe73929ABC0241a","description":"The grant will be used for standardizing the current API of NRverse for Decentraland purpose. The ultimate goal would be to offer seamless \"Decentraland Green Option\" or DGO in Decentraland platform for running on green electricity any land, event or user experience. This will mean that each time the DGO is activated each related electricity consumption around the world will be backed by renewable energy. \nFor doing so we will need to adapt the modules of NRverse to Decentraland specific parameters, we talk about: the calculator and the tokenizer of Renewables Energy Certificate and finally the interface. \n\n1) Calculator: First, and most important, is to develop the proper calculator modules adapted to Decentraland reality. \n1.1) Evaluation of electricity consumption: The electricity consumption is coming from multiple source: the end user device, the networking, the server of Decentraland. \nFor each of these electricity consumption centers, 2 aspects must be evaluated: the location and the amount of electricity during a certain period. In that context the project will develop a specific calculator based on the data from each user (IP address, wallet information, browser...) but also based on Decentraland servers data. \n\n1.2) Listening to Decentraland through SDK: Then the calculator will need to interface with the current Decentraland SDK to evaluate specific land information (e.g. amount of users, wallet information, transaciton happening...)\n\n-> The result of this should evaluate in real time the worldwide consumption of electricity of the activity on the land (e.g. parcel 45,62 consuming during last hour 30kWh in Germany, 1300 MWh in US, 48 kWh in Brazil...). \n\n2) Renewables Energy Certificate tokenizer: afterwards the amount of energy that is calculated needs to be extracted from existing Green certificate and tokenized into one NFT. \n2.1) Tokenizer: We need to create the smart contract that will generate the NFT including all the extract from  the different guarantee of origin. \n2.2) Update REC mother contract: We need to implement the logic that will update the smart contract that is containing the different original Renewables Energy Certificate (these are tokenized initially from a PDF coming from trusted issuers all over the world). \n\n3) User Interface: Second the interface for proposing Decentraland decarbonization services will be built. It includes a portal for organizing event (for corporate for example), the renting of Land. This will include partnership with player like moonbash and MGHDAO.\n\nUltimately we should have on one side an API that could be offer to anybody that wants to integrate in its land automated decarbonization and on the other side a portal that can help any participant, land owner to initiate the decarbonization of a land (continuously) or a simple event. On top we could include this certification explicitly into some ticket that can take any form of collectible.","specification":"1) The first capability of the product has been developed (in beta): upload the pdf Renewables Energy Certificate and transform them into an NFT.\nIn that process, the PDF's (from the initial Renewable Energy Certificate - REC) are parsed and data are stored in IPFS, they are then signed via Verifiable Credential thanks to the wallet of the REC's supplier (here metamask). The interface is to upload the data is a simple webpage. The NFT is then generated and transferred tot he wallet of NRverse. \nThe current chain used is Ethereum testnet because VC's / DiD are not available on polygon yet but that could be derived easily based  open source code from EWF (https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry) which was used by the team in the past in other projects. There is a full documentation about the API and the process which could be put at disposal.\n\n2) We need now to create the calculator capability for Decentraland and the related activities. This module will be most likely developed in javascript and will start by the evaluation of ethereum transaction notably based on McDonald calculation (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-emissions/blob/main/input/extra_data_label_regex.json ). \nFor the first version of the calculator the use in Decentraland will be based on benchmark as: laptop/desktop consumption, server consumption and networking from similar game and well as studies. Some details of technology architecture from Decentraland (servers, databases...) would help to evaluate more accurately the energy consumption. \nFor accurate calculation of an event or activity on a land the SDK of Decentraland will be used. Some advanced functionalities as conditional access to a parcel will also be used for specific event organisation for example. Another important interface will be the marketplace as certificate could be integrated as metadata of NFT to incentivize the explicit choice of participating to an event based on renewable energy. \n\n3) The last capability to develop will be the tokenizer module that will aggregate the NFT containing all the extract of the Renewables Energy Certificates will be developed in Polygon. \nThe wallet to be used will as well be Metamask and the payment will be managed in Mana.","personnel":"The project will be elad by Kai & Loic co-founder of NRverse and by their partners from BloxMove, MGH DAO and Lineup.\n\nKai Schmied is engineer with 10 years of experience in energy including 4 years fo experience in managing blockchain project in the context of the energy sector.

We are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.​\n​\n\nWe propose creating a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL, which will help the DCL community to stand out on the metaverse platforms since this creation will be the first significant symbolic representation within the four major metaverse platforms. We believe that Web3.0 will enable the mascot to work even more functionally. The reasons are as follows.​\n​\n\nFirst and foremost, a DCL Mascot is a powerful marketing tool as it makes it easier for DCL to create a physical and emotional connection with every member. We think that because Web3.0 community members are from all over the world and in most cases, they don't have the opportunity to meet each other face to face, it has become harder for them to generate a sense of belonging. However, with the help of a mascot and more varied promo campaigns, DCL can easily bring the whole community together. For example, mascot costumes can be designed for members to wear in metaverse events, which will go a long way to making DCL members stand out and feel proud of their identities.​\n​\n\nWhat's more, the mascot will give DCL a competitive advantage on social media as followers are more likely to engage with the digital mascot. From Twitter pages to DCL experiences, a mascot can appear on various platforms. Mascot memes can also be created for DCL members to use on every platform.​\n​\n\nLast but not least, the DCL Mascot will be a memorable IP.​\n​\n\nThe BEAM Studio Team and any additional designers will work closely together to develop a first-of-its-kind Mascot with a unique personality, interactivity, and emotional support.","specification":"To begin this project, we will create a survey to collect DCL community members' opinions about the mascot and analyze the common traits within the community to decide on a mascot form that will perfectly represent the spiritual core of the community. This grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what they stand for.​\n​\n\nOne key part of this project is to design the virtual character of the mascot. We will use AI, C4D, AE, and other design tools to produce digital work. If it's a human or animal mascot, we will design its facial expressions, clothing, colour schemes, etc. If it's an object mascot, we will focus on how to convey the community spirits through this item with a combination of visuals and metaphors.​\n​\n\nBefore finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and colour schemes. We plan to design mascot-related memes and motions in the future and plan to release these memes and motions on our discord server. The avatars of the community administrators will all be replaced by mascots, and information about the mascot will be posted in the server's announcement. We promise that we will promote Mascot not only on our Discord server but also on our other official social media accounts, such as WeChat, Twitter, etc. Through our vigorous promotion, people will greatly increase their awareness of the mascot, and the image of DCL's mascot will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When people see the mascot, they will think that it represents DCL.​\n​\n\nFinally, the launch of the DCL Mascot could be coupled with a marketing project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes to Decentraland as possible with this mascot. This will bring the potential impact of DCL on the metaverse, with the aim of further encouraging the adoption of Decentraland, highlighting how it brings the community together and enables DCL users to fund projects that they have faith in.","personnel":"The proposed team of the Decentraland Mascot is the following:​\n\nMori:​\nCrypto artist, senior visual designer & freelance illustrator.

The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:\n- Metaverse journalism\n- Media DAOs\n- Decentralized tools for journalists\n- Token Funding\n- Token-gated content\n- Token incentives for collaborators\n\nThe plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics. Potential candidates are:\n\n- Laurent Bainier - [20mint.fr](https://20mint.xyz/) Web3 project from the french magazine 20minutes\n- KevinOnEarth - [Decentraland Report](https://xpand.gg/community/the-decentraland-report)\n- Reporters without borders - [Uncensored Library Project](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en) ([Grant funded](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) by Decentraland DAO)\n- [Tinshui Yeung](https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/tinshui-yeung) - ICFJ Fellow researching web3 journalism\n- Know someone who is doing cool stuff around web3, metaverses, and journalism? Let us know in the comments!\n\n\n### Why this event?\n\nHosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.\n\nSome of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.\n\n### Why the Decentraland DAO?\n\nLet's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.","specification":"The total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**\n\nBudget breakdown\n\n![budget-breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bmPZjUm.png)","personnel":"[Gino Cingolani](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani) (Decentraland DAO / Media Party)\nDecentraland Governance Squad Product Lead, Media Party Line-up Programmer. \n\n[Maggie Farley](https://twitter.com/maggilista) (ICFJ)  \nICFJ Director of Knight Fellowships.

The Decentraland wearable creation process currently has a steep learning curve for non-technical 3D artists who want to express themselves or facilitate a brand experience. 2D artists currently are completely dependent on 3D artists to be included into the ecosystem; an inadvertent gate set up by the current wearables submission paradigm.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, non-3D-proficient submissions often lead to delays in the curation process as multiple rounds of submissions and back-and-forth between the curation committee can occur before a final design is honed and approved. This excessive iteration could lead to delays for brand items to be ready for events on time, but also strains the wearable-curation committee as the submission fee does not account for the time the experts ultimately spend reviewing. \n\n### Solution:\n\nWear Essentials will provide a platform for aspiring wearables creators to design wearables without technical barriers. An easy to navigate user experience will allow creators to upload a 2D image and see their graphic presented on a catalog of essential wearables in real time. The solution will then manage the submission and curation process, deploy the wearables, and provide analytics with feedback about their uptake and distribution. \n\nUpon submission to the wearables committee - an action which will be available right in the platform - the whole process of deployment and royalty management can be handled. Through use of payment splitter contracts on polygon, an allocation of creator funds raised through primary and secondary sales can be shared with the DAO.\n\nThe collection of templates can also be expanded over time in partnership with brands and organizations.\n\nIt makes it easier for creators as the platform will provide a set of guardrails to produce quality wearables. A set of template wearables - hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes - provide a foundation to ensure the end result will have the correct poly-counts and vertex weighting. Creators can then upload 2D imagery to be mapped on the templates. Users only need to make choices on template color and placement/size of the 2D image content to result in a wearable ready for submission to the committee. This opens up the whole ecosystem to 2D artists (illustrators, graphic designers, tattoo and traditional). \n\nIt reduces the burden on the DAO Wearables Committee as submissions coming direct from the platform have less for the team to review. Confident that the poly-counts and assets are templated, the focus can then be placed on the guidelines for the 2D images that users uploaded (approved content, IP-infringement issues, etc…). \n\nIt will increase revenue to the DAO in a few ways. Through the simplification of the wearables submission process, this platform may lead to an increase in submissions to the DAO. In addition, payment splitters or similar payment rails can be put in place to enforce revenue sharing of primary and secondary sales revenue directly with the DAO.

Lightspeed Graphics was launched in 2017 to create multimedia digital video experiences, commercial advertising, and graphic design, and would like to be the first to develop a new and exciting animated attraction within Decentraland.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics team believes in the need to bring Virtual Reality and storytelling as a truly rewarding and engaging experience to face challenges like user adoption, market size capture, and player satisfaction or retention among many other determinants. The VR industry will become more prevalent and interconnected to metaverse web3 applications as we reach mass adoption in the coming years and as new projects make their own unique metaverse-like experience. \n\nThe idea was inspired by the classic Ride Simulator Attractions seen at amusement parks, exhibits or tech museums that have been enjoyed for generations. We believe bringing this ride simulator experience into the metaverse will help bring value to Decentraland and help transition real world attractions or experiences into a connected metaverse experience.\n\nVeteran players and new players from AR/VR users, gamers, developers, film industry specialists, MX specialists and quite possibly well-known companies like Dynamic Attractions are all part of the target audience as we carve a space for VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attractions.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics Team and any additional contractors will work closely together to develop a first of its kind Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction with a complete narrative storyline, interactivity and future multiplayer experience.","specification":"The VR/Desktop Ride simulator will be accessible to the public and be distinguishable by the ‘Jump 2 Lightspeed’ logo. The size will need to be at least a 3x3 estate. The first adventure will be completely free to the public to ride indefinitely and be a learning experience for returning and new users to Decentraland. A crafting system will guide players to create unique wearables, in-game items and trade systems. Later, story add-ons called ‘Arcs’ will be gated by an initial purchase of an NFT, tickets, or subscription.\n\nOnce the Player has been granted access and has clicked the Ride Simulator, they are transported to a fixed chair position with the user’s perspective locked to the view of their avatar, while other avatars can be seen filling empty chair slots, (multiplayer experience), as the ride makes its final countdown to launch. Sponsored videos (will play during the countdown process to and promote other adventures, events, and activities throughout DCL.\n\nOnce the countdown has completed, no other players can join that adventure instance at this point. The lights dim and the animated adventure on screen begins playing.\nThe user has the option to enter fullscreen and see the entire video experience with a full monitor takeover, while the Oculus Headset user is now able to do a full headset takeover. \nThe game itself will feel like a rollercoaster ride through space, complete with narrative, voice over performances. Future development will bring the ability to fire and aim at targets with the mouse or Oculus controllers, making it a complete interactive game.","personnel":"Lightspeed Graphics:\nKirk Gonzales (CEO / Lead Designer)\nTwitter Handle: @AnmtrKirk\nLinkedin: linkedin.com/in/kirkgonzales\n\nAbout Me: I attended college for a B.A. from 2007 to 2011 in film and video production to learn everything needed behind movies, visual journalism and music videos.

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND! That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL. \nThe 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)\n- 1.5k per month for marketing \n- 2.5k per month for development","specification":"Our developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.

The wearables on the shop will benefit the players during the P2E. Perks will include power-ups and game avatars(Avatar Swap). This will raise the value of those NFTs, their ownership, the project and Decentraland.\n\n\nSkatepark P2E:\n\nPlayers will have tokens to collect, obstacules and enemies to avoid, compete for top scores, win prizes, use NFTs and enjoy a skateboarding game in Decentraland.\nSkatepark, characters, avatars and assets can be changed according to events, seasons and tournaments. This will allow other projects to join and give the opportunity for their communtities to experience NFT ownership utility, which will bring more traffic and value to Decentraland simultanously.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby. Inside the skatepark,the user can log in and play. There will be rounds of 3 minutes to catch a limited amount of tokens, enemies to avoid and diferent levels to unlock.\n\n\nClub:\n\nA place for events and promotional content, where users can join, hang out and celebrate. NFTs can be displayed and purchased, users can learn more about Decentraland, NFT utility, web3, watch in-game and IRL competitions, interviews, streamings, videos and interact with assets. \nWe will utilize this feature to bring more projects to decentraland and experience the metaverse, by offering a space where they can find their target costumers and give more utility possibilities to their community members and customers. \nThe skatepark and stage assets, characters and gallery can be customized. We are ready to host events, create avatars, wearables, assets and promotional content.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby or skatepark.\n\nHow will it be sustainable?\n\nOur plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more wearables for decentraland with game features will bring more value to the NFTs and Decentraland. \nThere are many people interested in skateboarding and we believe this project can expand quickly and bring gamers, IRL skaters, brands, NFT projects and their communuties if done on a bigger scale.\n\nOnce we have the HQ running we can generate income by: \n\n- Renting space for exposing NFTs and other merch, making them available for purchase\n- Custom events for clients\n- Creating/Selling NFTs with game utility\n- Selling merch(IRL or NFT)\n\nThe funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators.

However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.\n\nUnder the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience. \n\n### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest\nThe team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses. \n\n### Continued development of Decentraland VR\nDecentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.\n\nThe team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.","specification":"### Decentraland Native Quest Support. \n\nThe team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.\n\n\n### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements. \n\nAs mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR.","personnel":"The items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/","roadmap":"### Progress Updates\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum and DAO Discord channel closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

Our COO is Noah Jacobson who is a trained lawyer and operational leader. We've built our mobile app and just launched it this year in the Play and App stores and are gaining traction.  \nSkillProfile lets people create profiles made up of Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and then request anonymous feedback from their friends and colleagues and see the aggregate rating and comments. \nIt's like a 360 review but controlled by the individual and not limited to traditional employment or executives. It democratizes HR and Talent practices and puts it in the hands and control of the people themselves. It can also be extended to non-traditional employment and even game profiles (are you a good teammate, do you tilt under pressure, etc). \n\nWe would like to bring Skillprofile to the metaverse by creating a skills-based game and allows people to own their own profiles and then develop a place where people can share those profiles with others and expand the way we communicate and find employment or other like minded individuals in the metaverse.\n\nOur second phase would include the build out of a job board where users can share their SkillProfiles and potential employers or teammates can identify individuals who might be good candidates to either participate in their games, act as hosts, or do other necessary tasks to maintain the metaverse. Of course as Decentraland develops the way in which people interact could evolve in new and exciting ways so I hesitate to call it traditional employment but more like a place people can learn about themselves, develop their attributes and use them to create a life and experience they want.\nI believe we can create a place where what you bring to the table is verified, owned and is uniquely the individual and where others can find those people.","specification":"SkillProfile the app is already live in the Google Play store and the Apple App store and can be downloaded.

We would be extending the SkillProfile to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and to be able to be shared with others in Decentraland. We will also be creating an interactive experience or game to engage new users to claim theirs and start gathering feedback from people they interact with both in game and out.\nWith the grant we would purchase some land in Decentraland to create our scene and will be using Unity to develop an in world game/destination where participants can play, learn about skills.

Every day, MMORPGs bring together millions of people who form strong bonds, communities, and entire economies. Out of a shared passion with cryptocurrencies and MMORPGs, Exodus was born with the goal of making these communities and economies into real, consensus driven assets.\n\nThe name Exodus symbolizes a journey away from the online games we played and cherished as children and towards a new era where crypto assets allow gamers to create real value out of their playtime. We believe that time spent gaming is valuable and want Exodus to realize that belief. Exodus is themed around the concept of moving on from old ways of life and towards a better and more prosperous future. The character will begin in the medieval period and discover new resources, materials, tools, creatures, and questlines. Players will be able to play either passively or actively and work towards special items which will be represented as on-chain assets. The ultimate vision of Exodus is to have a full-fledged blockchain economy capable of providing opportunities to players of all types.\n\nThe JTV team has always focused on educational outreach when onboarding new users. As such, it has grown out of a mutual love for learning and having fun at the same time. The team has volunteered countless hours towards providing Decentraland content and will continue to grow to expand this outreach. JTV embodies this vision and has become a true goodwill of the Decentraland space. With Exodus, the JTV Development team aims to bring thousands of people to Decentraland to have engaging metaverse experiences.","specification":"Team & Experience:\n\nJTV Development is led by none other than JTV, a prominent Decentraland streamer and influencer. JTV streams multiple times a week to onboard new users and share his metaverse experience. Through his promotions and community events, he has distributed tens of thousands of wearables and provided a ‘first wearable’ to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people. JTV has inspired many Decentraland content creators through his goodwill and general want to better himself and his community. In the opinion of the grant writer (not JTV) – JTV deserves the entirety of this grant, though his intention is to support his team and community through the massive task of building Exodus.\n\nThe JTV Engineers include 3 professional software engineers, 1 software intern, and 4 professional designers/artists. This group provides experience in blockchain development, backend engineering, front-end user experience, 3D designs/animations, web-design, and story-writing. If there was a team with the dedication to achieve the vision of Exodus, this is that team. In fact, the team has already volunteered their time towards creating engaging content like the popular JTV Easter egg hunt and scavenger hunts. Despite this grant’s pending status, the team has eagerly begun full-stack development of Exodus.\n\nAs the Exodus project grows, the JTV team intends to provide new metaverse opportunities to design and software interns. We believe that this fits well with the teams focus on educational content and its theme of giving back to the community. This fits well with the mission of Decentraland to empower its players and to provide opportunities to those who seek them.\n\nRevenue sources:\n\nMemberships\n\nAd space \n\nCosmetic NFTs\n\nBackend services","personnel":"Socials:\n\ntwitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nTwitter @JTV____\n\ndiscord.gg/jtv\n\nSite for beta signups.

We intend to add multiple interns (at least 5 interns split between Engineering and Design) to add to this team.\n\nAllocation of Funds:\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering, Design, Marketing, and miscellaneous expenses like music, story writing, and server upkeep. Please understand, these values are approximate and may change depending on need. Engineering and design will include funds purposed towards hiring interns. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts: \n\nEngineering - $125,000 \n\nDesign – $75,000 \n\nMarketing - $25,000 \n\nMiscellaneous - $15,000","roadmap":"The primary release of Exodus will occur over a 6-month period with 3 phases: pre-beta, public-beta, and public release. The pre-beta phase will consist of a gradual release of gathering and crafting activities (woodchopping, fishing, mining, forging, cooking, scavenging), quests, and monster-hunting activities. Once fully rolled out, Exodus will transition into a public-beta purposed towards testing the game and preparing for public launch. Exodus intends to officially launch in January 2023.\n\nWe emphasize, the true roadmap of Exodus extends much further than the 6-month period of this grant. Our team intends to deliver a return of value to Decentraland for the long-term future. After public release, Exodus will continue to focus on attracting new players to Decentraland and building fresh content. Blockchain integration like wearables will be key features of Exodus, and will be continually developed for the game.\n\nWe believe that all grant recipients should strive to return the value of their grant plus some. As such, Exodus intends to contribute 5% of all revenue back to the DAO up to a total value of 300,000 USD. This is a small amount to offer in return for the critical support that the DAO would be providing with this grant and the team intends to deliver this. If successful, not only will this provide a return on the investment that the DAO makes with the grant, but it will also attract thousands of new players to Decentraland who can consume other metaverse content.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":11510,"scores_total":397602.7235427992,"votes":88,"manaVP":16329.305264410817,"landVP":196000,"namesVP":17800,"delegatedVP":167473.41827838842,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7"},{"id":"08d6b380-d3c1-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0","snapshot_id":"QmbaqkgBasjqefe6ZA1zsdsycNsyjfgBQnN1MhzoeVZKGg","user":"0xd41308f50858da2b7cc641e493fbddf34775393a","type":"grant","title":"Requesting Tier 3 Grant for purchase of land for NFT project Smvsh Friends","start_at":"2022-05-14T20:04:00.208Z","finish_at":"2022-05-21T20:04:00.206Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Requesting Tier 3 Grant for purchase of land for NFT project Smvsh Friends","abstract":"We are asking for funding to acquire a 1x1 parcel in Decentraland to house our NFT projects lounge and host regular, weekly community events.

The Pacific Cliffs Foundation (PCF) is a community run DAO aimed at winning the bid to lease the Lands End properties.  We are seeking a grant from the Decentraland DAO of $60,000 in order to secure our proposal and set the pieces in motion to make not only our campaign, but the eventual operation a success.\n\nWe have a proposal in place and have lofty plans concocted by local hospitality industry veterans, design professionals, world class construction firms, artists and local families to transform these epic properties into flourishing establishments for locals and tourists.  However, we need to garner the attention of the public in order to generate momentum.  Securing a Decentraland DAO grant will catapult our capabilities  to let us build out or vision and raise a public eyebrow to show that we are serious!\n\nHere's how it works.  The LEP properties will essentially be linked with Decentraland as a major on boarding hub \"in real life\" for Web3 and Decentraland.  Integrating Web3 technology and Decentraland to a tangible space in the real world creates an amazing opprotunity to show what is possible IRL and in the Metaverse.  More specifically, the event space on site will be a Decentraland Metaverse space to bring the Lands End properties and events to everyone around the world, and vice versa.\n\nHost an event on site at the LEP or in Decentraland and it will mirror that event.  For example if I am hosting an educational seminar about how NFTs can revolutionize the publishing industry in the actual event space, it will be broadcast to the corresponding location in Decentraland.","specification":"Upon receipt of the grant $Mana we will begin a course of action to accelerate our campaign.\n\n1.

Showcase the beauty of the property and potential the DAO can have while showcasing the link to Decentraland and how it can be beneficial to the people.\n3. Buy a land in Decentraland. \n4. Establish an office in SF where we can hire engineers, creatives and anyone needed to outline and develop our land to be modeled after the original Cliff House, establish our DAO and outline a plan for what to do once we obtain the lease.\n5. Create an NFT project using local artist and engineers where minting sales and secondary sales all go to the DAO treasury.  NFT project will be hosted and minted through the Land we develop in Decentraland.\n6.

Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. \n\nMAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking. \n\nWe believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.\n\n### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant? \n\nCurrently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.\n\n### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community\n#### Landowners Community\n\n MAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \\MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board. \n\n#### Builders\n\n Decentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there’s a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.\n#### General Community\n\n MAD’s Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space. Building on top of Decentraland, MAD could attract more people into the Decentraland world.","specification":"### Front end framework: Typescript React \n### Product 1: Radical Public Lease\n- Listing from DAO owned land pool and staking land pool [Smart Contract & Front end]\n- Bidding [Smart Contract & Front end]\n  - Harberger Tax employed here. see rules: https://medium.com/metaverse-advertisement-dao/introducing-metaverse-advertisement-dao-the-radical-market-6edb1a8ae7e5\n- Set Builder [Smart Contract]\n  - After a user successfully bids on a land parcel, the landowner can set the builder directly on MAD interface.

One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n- **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n- The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n- **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n- **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n- One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n- The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n- **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n- **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    - Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    - Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\nSure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n- We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL. \nSharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n- Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n- All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n- Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n- Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n- Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n- PvC mode improvements.\n- New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n- We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n- Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.","specification":"Six months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n\n- **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\nWe plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n\n- **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n\n- **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n\n- **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n\n- **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n\n- **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\nAnd combine these games into one unified economy.\nI am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.","personnel":"-   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago).

Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough.\nOur chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions.\nIn addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it.\nAs our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND!\nThat’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now.\nAll previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.\nSide note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.\nWhile we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.\nAlthough we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap! \n\nWe have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision… Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k).

Each of these have a different attacking style, skills and give different rewards.\n- 5 Spells like Lava Rage to throw a fireball at the opponent or Ice Cold to freeze the opponent.\n- XP and Leveling system to enable long term players to get the maximum earning potential and social clout\n- Beginner and Daily Quests to give the players a smaller goal with rewards \n- A Referral System where anyone can refer a new player to help both of them earn extra coins.\n- POAPs for key achievements in the game.\n- A Clan System where Clan Masters can delegate Clan Membership to other players and earn a passive income.

Players will take these materials and resources to the crafting station where they can craft vehicle tokens to redeem at the shop.

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations. \n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs. \n\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748","specification":"To begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build. \n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.","personnel":"This momentous undertaking is a collaborative effort between: \n\n- Reporters without Borders\n- DDB Berlin\n- Metaverse Architects\n- Metaverse Group \n- Tokens.com \n- BlockWorks\n- Media.Monks\n\nEach organization contributes crucial elements to the project.\n\nMore info:\n\nReporters without Borders promote and defend the freedom to be informed and to inform others throughout the world.\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach Berlin (DDB) is a leading advertising firm dedicated to supporting The Uncensored Library’s mission.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses.

But new players typically spawn into the metaverse with little clue about the true potential of this platform. Genesis Plaza provides players with numerous options to get involved in Decentraland, yet many remain confused or simply dormant. There needs to be a better and more consistent way to educate players about what’s possible in Decentraland and get them interacting with each other. \n\nMetaParty wants to take full advantage of Genesis Plaza by hosting welcome events, tours, and informative lessons in the numerous spaces available. Our team is experienced hosting fun and lively events, such as MetaVerse Fashion Week, that draw players of all experience levels into the metaverse. Our grant proposal would allow MetaParty to host regular events in Genesis Plaza that encourage players to explore Decentraland, learn about its features, and have fun interactions with other players.\n\nTo accomplish our goal, MetaParty will hire a series of tour guides in multiple languages to assist new players in Decentraland. This process will include accountability measures in which the community can track our progress via a sign-in sheet. MetaParty will train, oversee, and manage these tour guides to ensure quality experiences for new players. \n\nWe’ve created a YouTube video describing the proposal that shows a demo tour, which can be viewed at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyY8XqKaDg","specification":"We’re proposing the following:\n\nMetaParty staff members are present at Genesis Plaza five days a week Monday through Friday during 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC to give tours, host fun events, and teach new users about Decentraland.

But their art is that good that it absolutely has to be heard. We want to find these artists and make our offer. In addition we also support music and sound design for film, documentary and series. \n\nWith a “charitable social DeFi token” and Artist Project NFT´s it is possible for us to finance our NPO´s Projects and ensure a solid  Mission. \n\nIn addition to regular releases such as physical CD´s and digital Releases as Download and Streaming, we believe in creating NFT´s for each funded Artist Projects and each released Artist on our own Labels we just established.

So we create several Plots that Artists can use for presenting and  selling  Music and  all kinds of other digital Art as NFT´s. It will be a place like a Gallery. \n\nAs we can´t serve all Artists, we will have limited Spots. Artists can apply with examples and our A&R Team will decide about the Artists that are getting a Plot.

The Difference to a regular sold item in a Download Store is that NFT´s provide Studio Master Files, exclusive NFT-only Content. NFTs will be available 6-8 weeks BEFORE the Public release.\n\nThe Store will be Open to any other Artist with digital Art so we offer a wide range of music and digital Art to Decentraland.\n\nCreative Sandbox for In-World Builders\n\nWe will offer a Sandbox for Decentraland Builders who like to create any sort of Art inside of Decentraland. Same as with the Artist Plots, we offer Plots of different sizes free of charge to Builders.

When tokenizing properties, firms with large amounts of assets can easily inspect, control, or liquidate assets much easier. Tokenizing a property also means the ability for people to leverage assets to receive loans and build generational wealth. Whole countries will benefit because they can increase FDI and receive taxes directly from owner wallets. Citizens in countries with bad players in leadership will be protected from corruption and land right grabs because everything can be verified on the blockchain. One of the key components of the project will be the creation of the community governance which ensures it remains decentralized and never in control of the big banks. All that seems ideal but how does this impact or improve decentraland? Well home owners can quickly establish themselves and their property on decentraland using our NFT. The dao and community can use fees to increase DAO funds and the practicality of the ecosytem overall. Larger properties will boost the sale of other digital assets like art and furniture to decorate the digital property.

Rent in apartments will not exceed $450.00USD in MANA per month with 1 bed units starting at $225.00USD in MANA per month. Townhome rent will not exceed $950.00USD in MANA per month. We believe this project will provide the community with easily attainable housing that comes furnished as a place or places that can be used as a home or a hub for any metaverse business users may wish to begin creating.","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":50000,"beneficiary":"0xe7e477ef1676a46ae6621983834A6e0b29C06979","description":"Hello all! And thank you for taking the time to look over our project. We believe if we receive funding for our project we'd be solving a few issues that new and existing users share. To begin, building affordable housing within decentraland would make it so the community members who don't have a large budget will have a place of their own. In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours. Everyone deserves their own corner of the metaverse and that's what we are trying to achieve for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.","specification":"Once funding is received we would immediately go purchase the ESTATES required for building to begin.

Hence, we moved into SciArtLab where we have scaled into a cineplex with 6 floors including 3 floors with movie screens. SciArtLab has been a major support in marketing our vision to fellow DCL players. Check out the district http://district.sciartlab.com/\n\nWe are also building partnerships with rights owners from the entertainment industry. Some of the people that we have acquired from are\n\n1. Wave Films - http://wave-films.com/\n\n2. IndieRights -https://www.indierights.com/\n\n3. NewGen Entertainment - https://www.newgenentertainment.it/\n\n4.

Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF\n\nAs mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes\n\n1. We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2. We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1. Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live\nhttps://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\n2. Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.\n\n3. Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare.

Now, there’s a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.\n\nOur primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:\n- Make available a NFT ticket marketplace\n- Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers\n- Increase amount of events hosted\n- Grow daily active users\n- Expand awareness in the metaverse community\n- Create more use cases for LAND owners\n- Build interest in brands sponsoring future metaverse events\n- Improve user experience for event attendees\n- Increase wearable sales\n- Surge wearable and build creations\n- Provide our building on the metaverse as a people to meet & network\n- Help make Decentraland mainstream","specification":"In order for this to be possible we are building a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.\n\nWe also have created the Events SDK that allows event organizers to give access to the event to users who have purchased tickets. \n\nLink to the Github repo: https://github.com/Fanszoid\n\nUsing our Events SDK, event organizers will also be able to:\n- Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on. \n- Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event\n- Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating a post event ticket valuation.\n- Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration\n\nNow in-person event tickets could be attached to a Decentraland wearable. \n\nIn addition, we are communicating with the Festival District team, who worked with Decentraland on The Metaverse Festival, to see how Fanszoid could meet the future needs of promoters who need a ticketing solution. \n\nAs a final detail, we’ve launched our MVP, feel free to try it out. \nhttps://app.fanszoid.com/ \n\nFor more info about our proposal you can check this presentation:\nhttps://bit.ly/Fanszoid \n\nYou can also find us at: \n\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanszoid/ \n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/fanszoid \n\nWebsite - https://www.fanszoid.com/ \n\nTelegram - https://t.me/fanszoid \n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/GBv89mWgbQ","personnel":"Julian Neuss - Co-Founder & CEO - Software Engineer & crypto enthusiast.

In all those explorations, do you know how many people I’ve see outside the plazas (besides at the JP Morgan Chase house)? Three, and they were in one group.\n\nMany of us have properties, billboards, ads, and NFTs that lie dormant in the outside world. What’s the point of having these properties if no one is going to visit them?\nIn Decentraland, there is only one place outside a casino that gets much traffic: Wondermine Meteor Mining. Why does it get traffic? Because people can earn NFTs.\n\nTo get people to engage with our properties, NFTs, ads, billboards, etc., we need to encourage them to engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. To do that, I propose that we provide NFT awards for earning badges for engaging with the larger world.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\nTraveler’s Boots that award a 10% speed increase. These can be earned by exploring 20 miles of Decentraland.\n\nCuriosity Cap – Awarded for opening 150+ UIs to outside websites. Provides 5% discount on Marketplace purchases.\n\nAdventurer’s Sword – Awarded for completing Graveyard Quest, Quest of the Alcoholic Scarecrow, etc. This sword can be used to gain access to a separate questing zone with NPCs to fight and where they can earn money to use to buy more NFTs.\n\nGamer’s Gloves - Awarded to people who achieve high scores at all selected games, including The Adventures of Koko Jones, the Dragon Rush, etc. These can provide a 5% mining bonus for Wondermine.\n\nA list of badges can be found in each user’s dashboard, as well as a checklist for each that shows what they need to do to earn the badge and the associated NFT.\n\nEach badge category can have multiple levels, for instance different boots for exploring 20 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, all with different bonuses.","specification":"The framework for these goals already exist within Decentraland.

It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.\n\nI hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.\n\nWe can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.","specification":"This module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making the creation of courses significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.\n\nThe currently planned features are:\n-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.\n-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)\n-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.\n-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.\n-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game.","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo.

This will be a statue of Mikasa Ackerman (from the Attack on Titan anime TV series). Please read the story down below.\n4. Due to the fact that the statue is related to the Attack on Titan anime series, and I believe, has an impactful and emotional story behind it, it can attract the audience of the Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) TV series, which currently is THE most popular anime in the world with millions of people in its fandom. Also, the timing is just right, because for the time being the long-anticipated season 4 of AoT is finally on air.  \n\n\nTHE SHORT STORY BEHIND THE STATUE\n(spoiler alert)\n\nMikasa Ackerman is sitting next to Eren's grave while wearing the precious red scarf that Eren once gave her. This is the final scene of Attack on Titan manga, Chapter 139, where Eren after his death came in the incarnation of a bird and wrapped the scarf around Mikasa as he promised.\n\n\"I will wrap that scarf around you as many times as you want, now and forever\".\n- Eren to Mikasa.\n\nHOW I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA \n\nThis statue was my first personal project that I never finished till the end. I had an idea of making a 3d printable miniature for sale out of it and I even placed some work-in-progress images of it on my IG back in late May of 2021.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIuFxDD3aF/\n But since June 2021 I was very busy with my freelancing projects so I never had a chance to actually finish the statue and offer it for sale. So in this regard, it's a unique piece of work and was never sold to anyone. \n\nThus, here I am with my model of Statue of Love and I'd like it to be my dent in the universe of Decentraland.","specification":"This work is 90% finished, but I want to take 3 weeks to polish it and give it a more finished look.\n\nYou can check the work-in-progress images with the current look of the statue in my Google Drive that I created especially for you guys\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-xNmYEPM5-RmUSQMF37pOjz6AYnaXpl?usp=sharing\n\n\nIf you're interested to check some of my works, please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar","personnel":"I will be working on this project alone.

While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform.

While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies. \n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access. \n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.","specification":"The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first.

Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam).

That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.","specification":"Pawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform.

Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.\n\n**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.\n\n**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds.

In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance towards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have been exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical and conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.\n\nThe commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a speculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with them provides.\n\nWe aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added value to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct financing from communities to creators.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers, producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing","specification":"BeatBlox Muisc District:\n\nOur primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus of the BeatBlox expansion.

There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services.

WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","description":"When creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.","specification":"Acquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU","personnel":"**The team**\n\n* **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n* **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n* **Lew Co-founder**, 3D artist\n* **maruudn**, Community manager\n* **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)**, 3D artist","roadmap":"**2022 Q1**\n\n* Server improvements\n* WonderZone NFTs\n* Shared meteors\n* New wearables\n* Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n* In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n* Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n* More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n* Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n* In-game Pets\n* More wearables\n* Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n* Restructuring of the park","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3868,"scores_total":13324438.083519965,"votes":237,"manaVP":9395154.137505237,"landVP":3380000,"namesVP":104900,"delegatedVP":444383.9460147345,"vesting_address":"0xe8a1B5F25b3bF789aFAe04f3F11C0e7d0F527973","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935","token":"DAI","vesting_released":240000,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":240000,"vesting_status":"Finished","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"7d204d10-5f3f-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7","snapshot_id":"Qma3e7ECfYNPiyxXHVUdtPiQxVxX3AdatBEntDn58AB9JA","user":"0x46d8603959f92b0cff6d453c15c3bbfa945ee890","type":"grant","title":"Copywriter","start_at":"2021-12-17T13:44:00.849Z","finish_at":"2021-12-24T13:44:00.848Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Copywriter","abstract":"Looking for an excellent English/French writer to showcase your startups or product in Metavers?\nOr a quality Trader influencer on Instagram?\n\nHere is your happiness: Mr Passave Christopher , a 19-year-old commercial prep student, delivers his services to you on demand so that your nugget can be known at the four corners of the Metaverse !","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0x46D8603959f92b0Cff6D453c15C3BbFA945Ee890","description":"Hello, my name is Passave Christopher and I offer a quality writing and communication service.

Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.","personnel":"### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space.

Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land).

This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n \n**WonderZone NFTs** \nMany of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding. \n \n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**\nCurrently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n \n**Kingfisher social fishing game**\nSome of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future.

Additionally, this space would function as a study environment and safe, social zone for intellectuals.

From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself. Work completed within the METAcademy may be minted as NFTs for collectibles within Decentraland, with duplicates donated to the learning facility collections. Learners may utilize \"rooms\" within the METAcademy to study alone or with peers and participate in discussions. Enter the next generation of education and learn something new today!","specification":"To obtain the name \"METAcademy\" within decentraland, it would cost .007328 ETH. Also, the cheapest parcel of land currently listed for sale is located at -56, -133 for 3,450 ETH.  Alternatively, this design may work with other, more fiscal hosting options. A GoFundMe has also been created to promote donations from intellectuals hoping to secure a location for safe and limitless learning: https://gofund.me/d300c2e2 . This location would act as a host for the different classes offered by teacher users. Learners could assemble and select a class and teacher within the server to be relocated for sessions. Educators may utilize their Avatars to interact with students within Decentraland, list zoom links for online class learning, or use Google systems for materials, links, and videos. Several starter NFTs have already been minted for interaction including the building and emotes: 0xee8f3df7e0a66f2943133eb43dd29b354df060f9\nContracts for educators would include sections which agree to refrain from certain interactions and content. Educators would be independent contractors responsible for the materials, instruction, and feedback for learners.","personnel":"I'm TeacherBr00ke (Brooke Cadieu) and I proposed this learning facility after discovering the new society of online users looking to shape the future. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven. \n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.","roadmap":"Beginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":3215,"scores_total":1614235.5621311036,"votes":34,"manaVP":97278.1414551533,"landVP":1170000,"namesVP":23500,"delegatedVP":323457.42067595007,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":null,"category":"Community","tier":"Tier 6","size":240000,"beneficiary":"0x915Aa85DC088ea2d5850d44f9A21c7BF388A9672"},{"id":"8b7dac40-5152-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmV66KKqnv5rmaJPK6uo5Wru3sbx1QTmABdbBMY1ZB9Ze6","user":"0x8238d6d79a2d04999f5872db80812589f6bf689b","type":"grant","title":"Request funds for expanding Decentraland Thailand","start_at":"2021-11-29T20:25:00.108Z","finish_at":"2021-12-06T20:25:00.108Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Request funds for expanding Decentraland Thailand","abstract":"Greeting DCL community,\n\nDCL and MANA just changed my life!

Land owners also lack an available set of easily installed scene games, which provide valuable content, without purchasing such content through development teams or external sites.\n\nThis development grant seeks to target these two problems by providing a:\n- functional code-base that can be accessed by developers to further their understanding of DCL development\n\n- playable scene preview that can be easily accessed to show new users a small portion of DCL's potential\n\n- functional game that land owners can freely host on their land\n\nThis project is the first in a series I am planning on developing. I'm starting small, mostly board-games and old computer games, to create a start point for any new developer. However, I am aiming to implement larger projects such as tower defence and card games. By implementing these projects and providing them to the community we should be able to make things easier for new developers, stimulate land owners to develop their land with free modules, and attract new users!","specification":"The core design factor here is ease-of-use. The program will be created using modular design and a heavy focus on implementing interfaces. This means developers will be able grasp the high-level concept of implementation (how all the pieces fit together) and how each function works  (what the individual pieces do). This also provides users a way to add this game to their scenes without needing to have an understanding of programming.\n\nCheckers will be the game that this module will be centred around. Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene. This means a single scene could host several boards at one time, allowing for land owners to create plazas or hubs for users to play at!\n\nWhen completed, the code-base will be publicly hosted on Git so anyone interested can access/download the files. A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want. All rights to the code-base will be waived, pushing it directly into the community's ownership and allowing interested parties to do with it as they please (including hosting on their land/building upon the project/monetizing play).","personnel":"I'll be working on this project solo, its a little too small to pull any teammates in. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the projects I've implemented and polished for DCL is Minesweeper, which is currently playable [here!] (https://vercel-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/)","roadmap":"The current estimate for this project is two weeks. During the first week I will implement the functional code and provide a preview of the game scene. By the end of the second week I will have polished the code to maximize readability and optimized the scene to run efficiently. During this time the Git code-base will be made available and the playable preview will be hosted!\n\nThank you for your time,\nTheCryptoTrader69","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":2854,"scores_total":2556974.201124273,"votes":10,"manaVP":2237674.2011242723,"landVP":216000,"namesVP":1300,"delegatedVP":102000,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":"0xf493a2ad834443481c00b1dc8232d7d9f5741c6b6b159124cf5fcb878550f463","category":"Gaming","tier":"Tier 1","size":1000,"beneficiary":"0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003","token":"MANA","tx_date":"2021-12-16T13:52:39Z","tx_amount":308,"done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"3511f910-4167-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmUnSy8Pn4LVrJheajHa6Rt3HhNm4Lww9sBWhAXcqoKSc7","user":"0x9b3ae2dd9eaad174cf5700420d4861a5a73a2d2a","type":"grant","title":"Decentraland DAO incubated project - Meta GamiMall (+ P2E game Super Dogerio)","start_at":"2021-11-09T14:13:00.945Z","finish_at":"2021-11-16T14:13:00.945Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"enacted","configuration":{"title":"Decentraland DAO incubated project - Meta GamiMall (+ P2E game Super Dogerio)","abstract":"The story starts from the success of the Meta City Launch, people enjoy the experience, our displayed NFTs and our gifts, so, why not expand the idea and turn it into a place where people can play, can earn and can shop?

Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4. \n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services. \n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well.

It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants.

We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue.

We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won’t be just a  ‘tour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.\nI fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I’d love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.","specification":"Hire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.\nHire Website Designer, Videographer\nEducate introductory tour guides\nAny left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!","personnel":"Astrid Pilla, Here's my LinkedIn Profile! https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridpilla/\nAnd my website about page:  https://www.nftcreatortours.com/about\nI’ve conducted docent tours around the Metaverse during DCL 100xArt Week, have volunteered with NFTs.tip s both on the Admin side and as a Clubhouse Room moderator, a writing contributor to NFTS.WTF, helped with several drops and am currently helping about 8 high profile NFT projects as we speak.

After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\n          The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.","specification":"This is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well.

The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows.

Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1. City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely “wired“ from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2. Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3. User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.  \n\nSummary of work:\n\n* Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox\n* Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature\n* Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed\n\n#### Demo / POC\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74","description":"Full Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md\n\n\n### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items  \n\n\n##### Trigger Types\n\nIncludes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square\n\nI want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n\n##### Text Displaying Types \n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.  \n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.  \n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here \n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n* Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n* Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n* Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.  \n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","personnel":"I already have one successful approved grant with delivered content.

I want to share it all.\n\nAs of yesterday, I've released an early build of the tools for the community - https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53","description":"You'll be able to easily:\n- Place good looking (and performant) highlight boxes\n- Add holdable/intractable items that will make GAME making so much easier\n- Animate UIImage and UIText with ease. fadeTo, moveTo, scaleTo, ect.\n- Inventory system for displaying details about your holdable items\n- Storage system for placing entities into containers easily\n- Debug tools for placing items in the game, instead of saving and refreshing often\n- Audio/Video sound GUI for your parcel users to adjust volumes for individual audio sources.\n- Experience bars that animate when the value is updated\n- Much much more.\n\nRequests for common problems can be added to the github issue queue for my repo. I'm slowly adding in all of the things I've built. This obviously takes a large amount of time, and I'm doing it for free. Please consider this proposal. What I have already provided should benefit the community already, with some extra mana funds I'll be able to purchase some more land for testing out more interesting experiments which will also be rolled back into the community library I've created.\n\nPlease visit farm (DecentraFarm) to see many of these elements working together (It's still a work in progress obviously)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=0%2C-1&realm=unicorn-blue\n\nAlso visit my comedy/bar venue (TheBlock) - (Also a work in progress)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=-18%2C-122&realm=unicorn-blue","specification":"I'm going to set up a semantic version control for the project very soon.

Tutorial videos will be included for each component, as well as detailed documentation about implementation.","personnel":"Patmacs - I'm very active (maybe even annoyingly so) in the #SDK discord channel. I have over 20 years experience in web development, 18 years professionally. JS/TS, APIs, React, Blender, Photoshop, Solidity, ect. I've done it all probably. Hit me up in discord to test my knowledge/experience on a specific topic.","roadmap":"Over the next few weeks I'll be moving a lot of the code from DecentraFarm into TheBlock in anticipation of a formal grand opening.  This will be done by first adding each feature to the dclconnect npm library,  documenting the process, recording videos, and implementing them into the venue. This process drastically extends the release of my own venue. However, I believe it's worth the effort, if the community can find these tools useful.\n\nThe feature list is included in the Description.\n\nA second phase may include another batch of components/entities that are specifically requested by the community. It may require an additional grant to develop. I'm not quite sure yet.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1297,"scores_total":1459494.7801319598,"votes":38,"manaVP":1029494.7801319604,"landVP":430000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":"0x78b311f4BE9969C41931aDA45d6eC53Bf54998Cf","enacting_tx":null,"category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 3","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53","token":"MANA","vesting_released":7042.25352113,"vesting_releasable":0,"vesting_start_at":"2021-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_finish_at":"2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","vesting_token_contract_balance":0,"vesting_total_amount":7042.25352113,"vesting_status":"Finished","done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"87a5a860-d994-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b","snapshot_id":"QmSYP5zuFyLYz7vjefeUW8S35iuUCSAqnENFFcjh8iKX6e","user":"0x119e6f4644651e77eeb7031f4988ba29346d9608","type":"grant","title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","start_at":"2021-06-30T11:15:00.910Z","finish_at":"2021-07-07T11:15:00.910Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"Help fund my journey to the TEDtalk circuit","abstract":"I am going to be hiring a \"Life Coach\" that specializes in assisting people to prepare and finalize their TEDx.

Making it possible to engage with our art in the metaverse and in the real world. We feel this will be a blueprint for the streetwear community bridging their creations to Decentraland. We know that as a  independent designer with conviction we want to spread our vision across every known universe even the parallel. In addition to the wearables and art we will bring the music that is a major cultural part of the brand dna. Having already worked on real world events with artists like Seth Troxler, Martinez Brothers, A$AP Rocky, and some of the best DJs from Berlin to London to Hong Kong and Brazil we see an after party as the best way to bring the vision into the full audio visual experience by recruiting a nice lineup of artists to share a great event with the Decentraland community to celebrate with ALIVE AND MORE","specification":"The wearables will be by the designer and artist behind ALIVE AND MORE Karl Phenom ( http://instagram.com/karlphenom \nHaving the first hand experience in the construction and design of the original real world pieces will make executing the Decentraland wearables with as much authenticity possible a key in the results of the works.\n\nFor the After party event we plan to stream live video of Djs performing from around the world at their respective studios using OBS Studio and RTMP-Server.com as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBDf-dR7DU\n\nWhile the aim will be to live stream the dj sets we may or may not accept pre-recorded video of the performances and then stream them live at the event for the first time to the community","personnel":"Karl \"Phenom\" Jouanni based in Ibiza, Spain aka the Illustrious one the Art Creative Director, Designer and Founder of ALIVE AND MORE and TEAM RELMS ( https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/fashion/alive-and-more/ )  will head the majority of the wearable designs using Photoshop, Blender, Unity and Maya.

We offer the community to buy/sell/ collect and with some proposed gamified elements we will introduce the opportunity to win the ALIVE wearables.  Following the launch we will then throw the after party event 3 weeks later as a completion to the first Alive Decentraland Fashion week season offering. We will invite the community to enjoy the live music and show off their wearables and how they chose to combine them with their looks and avatars if they did get a chance to grab one.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.  \n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in. \n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.    \n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.","specification":"This project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.  The approach will be to utilise what is already available before building anything new.  \n\nThe University District and its already established structures such as Decentraland University and Learning Spheres, will make for a suitable location to run this event, though some additional development is foreseen as necessary. \n\nA small research study will be performed to identify the feasibility of all existing reusable resources for this event.  The outcome of the research study will report a detailed plan of implementation using agile and iterative development methodologies.  \n\nNecessary modifications and additions to scenes/features will be developed through the Decentraland SDK and 3D modelling software (such as Blender).  This project will contribute to the open-source code repositories.    \n\nAlready identified existing [GitHub](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes) resources include:\n- Wearables-store\n- Crypto-valley-art-gallery\n- Clap-meter\n- POAP-Booth\n- Nft-scanner\n- Ws-broadcast\n- Switchboard-platforms\n- Grab-objects\n- Guest-Book-API\n- Beer-dispenser\n- Donations-Box\n- Paid-Button\n- Paid-Lever\n- Sliding-door\n- Npc-dialog-example-scene\n- Events-API\n- Digital-bouncer\n- Basic-Interactions\n- Grab-objects-advanced\n- discordWebsocket\n- Nft-wall-example-scene\n\nExperience has been gained in using the SDK and deploying dcl scenes to local development environments.","personnel":"This project will be managed by [Troy Sadkowsky](https://www.google.com/search?q=troy+sadkowsky), CTO and Data Scientist at [Data Logical Services Pty Ltd](https://datalogicalservices.com/).

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control \nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) \nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.  \n\n##### Scene Add/remove\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.","specification":"### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here \n\n[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.","personnel":"### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here [https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.  \nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27  \n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.  You can find my submission here:\nhttps://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/a1890011-77d7-415c-aeb2-452e3a186391?realm=localhost-stub.  Again I used the Builder and but this time also the SDK to enhance the Voxter smart item given to the contestants improving its experience and features in the Builder.  Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2","roadmap":"### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.","choices":["yes","no"]},"discourse_topic_id":1194,"scores_total":1198561.1450458097,"votes":36,"manaVP":876561.1450458096,"landVP":322000,"namesVP":0,"delegatedVP":0,"vesting_address":null,"enacting_tx":"0x14790738ee100309cd7038d17b289292b2109af7c0d18aa40d9095f9827d3264","category":"Platform Contributor","tier":"Tier 2","size":3000,"beneficiary":"0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74","token":"MANA","tx_date":"2021-07-14T20:40:09Z","tx_amount":5000,"done_updates":0,"late_updates":0,"missed_updates":0,"pending_updates":0},{"id":"d0a802a0-d378-11eb-987d-410735a966ad","snapshot_id":"QmcEtXsQLg9nY3ACAPFivBrHMTZo1KpKF1niFsJYrF5Br6","user":"0x6411a6771684e0b8535b57e64fb81d1a7facea07","type":"grant","title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","start_at":"2021-06-22T16:42:00.514Z","finish_at":"2021-06-29T16:42:00.514Z","required_to_pass":1000000,"status":"rejected","configuration":{"title":"I want to start a youtube channel.","abstract":"I want to start a youtube channel, of motor biking, showing the beauty of North-east India.
